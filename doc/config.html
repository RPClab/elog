   <i>Global and individual logbook options for an ELOG server</i>
</div>
<hr>
<p>
   The configuration file <b><code>elogd.cfg</code></b> contains entries
   which define the structure of logbooks and the behaviour of
   <code><b>elogd</b></code>. The file has a simple ASCII format. Each
   logbook is defined by a <b><code>[&lt;name&gt;]</code></b> section where
   &lt;name&gt; is the name of the logbook. The <b><code>[global]</code></b>
   section is used for settings common to all logbooks. Each line contains a
   setting name, followed by an equal sign and the value for this setting.
   Lines starting with ";" are treated as comments.
</p>
<p>
   Here is a simple example, which define two logbooks, "<i>Linux</i>" and
   "<i>PC</i>":
</p>
<ul>
   <li>
<pre>
[global]
SMTP host = mailsend.your.domain

[Linux]
Theme = default
Comment = General linux tips and tricks
Attributes = Author, Type, Category, Subject
Options Type = Routine, Software Installation, Problem Fixed, Configuration, Other
Options Category = General, Hardware, Software, Network, Account, Other
Options Author = Stefan, Linus, unknown
Required Attributes = Author

[PC]
Comment = Database PC installations
Attributes = Location, OS, Owner
Options Location = Building1, Building2
Options OS = Linux, Windows ME, Windows 2000
Required Attributes = Location, Owner
Email All = name@address, othername@otheraddress
Use Mail Subject = Location
</pre>
   </li>
</ul>
<p>
   <a name="global" id="global"></a>
</p>
<hr>
<div class="title">
   Global options
</div>
<p>
   The notation of the following options is such that items enclosed by
   <b>"&lt;"</b> and <b>"&gt;"</b> should be replaced by a specific string.
   If a value contains blanks (like a complete sentence), it should
   <b>not</b> be enclosed in quotation marks.
</p>
<p>
   If a setting has a number of possible options, they are shown in the form
   <code><b>option1|option2|...</b></code>, meaning that one of the options
   (without any vertical bar) should be used. The following options are
   specific to the <b><code>[global]</code></b> section:
</p>
<ul>
   <li>
      <b><code>Port = &lt;port&gt;</code></b><br>
      Specifies the TCP port under which the server is listening. Default is
      80. Can be superseeded via the '-p' command line flag.
   </li>
   <li>
      <b><code>SSL = &lt;0 | 1&gt;</code></b><br>
      Turn on Secure Socket Layer transport. If SSL is on, one can connect
      via <code><b>https://...</b></code> to the elogd daemon. If the
      <code><b>URL =</b></code> directive is used, make sure to use
      <code><b>https://...</code></b> instead of <code><b>http://...</code></b>
      there. The ELOG distribution contains a simple self-signed certificate
      in the <code><b>ssl</b></code> subdirectory. One can replace this
      certificate and key with a real ceritficate to avoid browser pop-up
      windows warning about the self-signed certificate. The default for
      this option is <code><b>0</b></code>.
   </li>
   <li>
      <b><code>Interface = &lt;interface&gt;</code></b><br>
      Specified network interface to listen at. Can be used if several network
      cards are in a computer, or if one wants to restrict access to the
      local host only, in which case one can use 127.0.0.1 as the interface.
   </li>
   <li>
      <b><code>Resource dir = &lt;directory&gt;</code></b><br>
      Specifies the root directory for ELOG resources like help files,
      themes and icons. Can be overwritten with the
      <b><code>-s</code></b> flag when starting elogd. If not specified, use
      the directory where the configuration file
      <b><code>elogd.cfg</code></b> resides. <i>Changing this option requires
      a restart of the elogd server</i>.
   </li>
   <li>
      <b><code>Logbook dir = &lt;directory&gt;</code></b><br>
      Specifies the root directory for logbooks. Can be overwritten with the
      <b><code>-d</code></b> flag when starting elogd. If not specified, use
      the directory where the configuration file
      <b><code>elogd.cfg</code></b> resides. Each logbook data is stored in a
      separate directory under this root directory specified by the
      <b><code>Subdir</code></b> option. <i>Changing this option requires a
      restart of the elogd server</i>. This directory also contains any
      password file and user HTML file.
   </li>
   <li>
      <b><code>Language = &lt;name&gt;</code></b><br>
      The language setting determines the language of the
      <code><b>elogd</b></code> output. Not affected by this setting are the
      configuration file options and the commands specified with the optional
      <code><b>Menu commands</b></code> and <code><b>List menu
      commands</b></code>, which have to be specified in English and are
      translated automatically by elogd. The attribute names are unaffected
      by the language setting and have to be translated manually.<br>
      <br>
      If a language name is given (currently "<i>german</i>",
      "<i>french</i>", "<i>spanish</i>", "<i>dutch</i>", "<i>brazilian</i>"
      are supported out-of-the-box), the system searches for a file named
      <b>eloglang.&lt;name&gt;</b> containing string translations from
      English into that language. <i>If you create a new translation file,
      please send it back to the author to be included in future
      distributions</i>.<br>
      <br>
      The online help for <code><b>elogd</b></code> is contained in the file
      <b>eloghelp_<i>xx</i>.html</b> where <i>xx</i> are the first two
      letters of the language (like "<i>en</i>", "<i>ge</i>" and
      "<i>fr</i>"). For new languages, a new file of that type must be
      created as well.
   </li>
   <li>
      <b><code>charset = &lt;name&gt;</code></b><br>
      Specifies the charset of the pages produced by
      <b><code>elogd</code></b>. Can be used to switch to Russian or Asian
      fonts.
   </li>
   <li>
      <b><code>Logbook Tabs = [0|1]</code></b><br>
      This flag controls the display of "<i>tabs</i>" on top of the logbook
      page which allow to quickly switch between logbooks. Default is
      <b><code>1</code></b>
   </li>
   <li>
      <b><code>Main Tab = &lt;string&gt;</code></b><br>
      If this option is present, an additional first tab is displayed which
      takes you back to the main logbook selection page. The
      <b><code>string</code></b> is used for the contents of the tab.
   </li>
   <li>
      <b><code>Main Tab URL = &lt;string&gt;</code></b><br>
      Normally the main tab brings one back to the logbook selection page.
      In case one wants to specify a different destination, such as a
      special web page outside of elog, one can use this statement
      to specify a full URL.
   </li>
   <li>
      <b><code>Welcome Title = &lt;html code&gt;</code></b><br>
      This optional HTML code gets displayed in the title of the logbook
      selection page. It can contain images via <b><code>&lt;img
      src="welcome.gif"&gt;</code></b>. These images must be stored in the
      resource directory or in the theme directory.<br>
      <br>
      The following line is an example Welcome Title:<br>
      <br>
      <pre>
Welcome title = &lt;img src="welcome.jpg"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size=5 color=white&gt;Welcome to our Elog&lt;/font&gt;
</pre><br>
      This displays an image and a text below.
   </li>
   <li>
      <b><code>Page title = &lt;string&gt;</code></b><br>
      The string specified here is used for the title of individual logbook
      pages. It is also used by most browsers for bookmark names.
      &lt;string&gt; can contain substitutions like $&lt;attribute&gt; where
      &lt;attribute&gt; gets replaced by the attribute string from each
      message. The option <b><code>Page title</code></b> in the
      <b><code>[global]</code></b> section is used for the logbook selection
      page.
   </li>
   <li>
      <b><code>List page title = &lt;string&gt;</code></b><br>
      The same for the summary or find result page. This may include
      substitutions as well, although attribute substitutions make no sense
      here, since the summary page may contain many messages with different
      attributes.
   </li>
   <li>
      <b><code>Selection page = &lt;file&gt;</code></b><br>
      When this option is present, a user defined file is displayed instead
      of the logbook selection page. This file must be stored in the resource
      directory. Alternatively, an absolute path can be used if the file name
      starts with a <b><code>"/"</code></b> (Unix) or <b><code>"\"</code></b>
      or <b><code>"x:"</code></b> (Windows).<br>
      <br>
      It can be completely customized in order to contain logos etc. As a
      template, the standard selection page produced by
      <code><b>elogd</b></code> can be used.
   </li>
   <li>
      <b><code>Guest Selection page = &lt;file&gt;</code></b><br>
      The same for installations which have a global password file. This
      means that the logbook selection page is also password protected. It
      might be however that some logbooks have guest access, in which case
      guest access to the selection page should be allowed as well (maybe
      with only a subset of the available logbooks). In that case this
      options can be used, to show a list of logbooks with guest access.
   </li>
   <li>
      <b><code>Protect Selection page = 0 | 1</code></b><br>
      Normally, one can see the logbook selection page without having to log
      in. If one wants to require a login for the selection page, this switch
      can be set to <b><code>1</code></b>. Default is <b><code>0</code></b>.
      It is necessary to put the <code><b>Password file = ...</b></code> into
      the <i>[global]</i> section of the config file for this to work.
   </li>
   <li>
      <b><code>Expand Selection page = 0 | 1</code></b><br>
      If this option is not present or set to one, the logbook selection page
      is expanded (all logbooks are shown if groups of logbooks are present).
      If this option is zero, only the group names are displayed. If one
      clicks on a group, its logbooks are shown. Using this option set to
      zero only makes sense if one has a large number of logbooks which would
      not fit on a single browser window, so collapsing makes sense. Default
      is <b><code>1</code></b>.
   </li>
   <li>
      <b><code>SMTP host = &lt;host.domain&gt;</code></b><br>
      This defines the SMTP host needed to send automatic email
      notifications. The host name you can get from your email program or
      your local system administrator.
   </li>
   <li>
      <b><code>SMTP username = &lt;username&gt;</code></b><br>
      Some SMTP server require username/passowrd authentication. This option
      specifies the SMTP user name, while the option <code><b>SMTP
      password</b></code> can be created or modified via the
      <code><b>-t</b></code> switch when starting elogd. This is necessary
      since the password is encrypted. To set your SMPT password, enter on
      the command line:
<pre>
elogd -t &lt;your password&gt;
</pre>
   </li>
   <li>
      <b><code>SMTP port = &lt;port&gt;</code></b><br>
      This defines the port under which the SMTP server is listening. The
      default is 25, but some newer servers use port 587.
   </li>
   <li>
      <b><code>Logfile = &lt;file&gt;</code></b><br>
      This option specifies a filename which logs all login/logout activities
      and successful user connections for logbooks with user level access.
      The the <code><b>logging level</b></code> (see below) is larger than 1,
      also read and write accesses can be logged.
   </li>
   <li>
      <b><code>Logging level = 1 | 2 | 3</code></b><br>
      Specifies the logging level. The higher this value, the more
      information is logged. Default is <b>2</b>:
      <ul>
         <li>
            <b>1:</b> Log only logins and logouts
         </li>
         <li>
            <b>2:</b> Log also write accesses
         </li>
         <li>
            <b>3:</b> Log also read accesses
         </li>
      </ul>
   </li>
   <li>
      <b><code>URL =
         &lt;http[s]://host.domain[:port]/[subdir/]&gt;</code></b><br>
      If one of the three cases is true:
      <ul>
         <li>
            <code><b>elogd</b></code> runs with <i>SSL</i> enabled
         </li>
         <li>
            <code><b>elogd</b></code> runs under a proxy
         </li>
         <li>The automatic email notifications contains the wrong URL
         </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
         then the URL under which <code><b>elogd</b></code> is running has to
         be specified manually with this statement. The URL has to contain the
         port number if not the standard port 80 is used or 433 for SSL,
         and it has to contain the directory if used under a proxy like<br>
         <br>
      </p>
      <table border="0" cellpadding="10">
         <tr>
            <td>
               <code>URL = http://host.domain:8080/</code>
            </td>
            <td>
               if running on port 8080
            </td>
         </tr>
         <tr>
            <td>
               <code>URL = https://host.domain/</code>
            </td>
            <td>
               if SSL is enabled (SSL = 1)
            </td>
         </tr>
         <tr>
            <td>
               <code>URL = http://host.domain/subdir/</code>
            </td>
            <td>
               if running under a proxy
            </td>
         </tr>
      </table>
      This URL is then used for any redirection. For example if one submits a
      new entry, the URL in the browser reads
      <b>...&lt;logbook&gt;/?cmd=Submit&...</b>, containing all the attributes
      etc. After the submit this page gets redirected to
      <b>...&lt;logbook&gt;/&lt;ID&gt;</b>, where &lt;ID&gt; is the ID of the
      new entry. For the redirection via the HTTP "Location:" statement, an
      absolute URL is required. Since elogd cannot figure out the complete
      URL under which it is running when accessed through an Apache proxy, this
      statement is necessary to tell elogd the complete URL.
   <li>
      <b><code>Relative redirection = 0|1</code></b><br>
      Under some circumstances, absolute redirection via a complete URL may
      not work. If you access elogd through two different ways simulataneously,
      for example directly and via a stunnel connection, a single absolute
      URL cannot be used, because one connection starts with <b>http://</b>, and the
      other with <b>https://</b>. Another case is when the elogd server has
      a dynamic IP address, which changes from time to time. Setting
      <b><code>Relative redirection = 1</code></b>,
      relative redirection is used. This uses the current URL from the browser,
      whatever it is, and only specifies the last part of the URL. It should
      noted however that relative redirections are not allowed in the HTTP
      standard, but most browsers support it anyhow. Problems have been reported
      with the Safari browser. So this option should only be used when it is
      really needed.
   </li>
   </li>
   <li>
      <b><code>Usr = &lt;name&gt;</code></b>
   </li>
   <li>
      <b><code>Grp = &lt;name&gt;</code></b><br>
      The user and group to run the elogd daemon under when started by root.
   </li>
   <li>
      <b><code>Resolve host names = 0|1</code></b><br>
      Resolve remote host names if set to <b>1</b>. If set to <b>0</b>, which
      is the default, only IP numbers are stored in any log file. If the
      <b><code>hosts allow/deny</code></b> options are used with host names,
      this setting must be set to <b>1</b>. If turned on, the DNS server is
      contacted on each HTTP request to elog, which can slow down the server
      considerably for slow DNS servers.

</ul>

<div class="section">
   Groups of logbooks
</div>
<p>
   If installations have very many logbooks, it can be hard to navigate
   between them. To make things more structured, it is possible to build a
   hierarchy of logbooks. A logbook group can contain any number of logbooks
   as well as other logbook groups. The hierarchy is defined with the the
   option
</p>
<p>
   <code><b>Group &lt;group name&gt; = &lt;Logbook1&gt;, &lt;Logbook2&gt;,
      &lt;other group&gt;</b></code>
</p>
<p>
   in the <b><code>[global]</code></b> section of the configuration file.
</p>
<p>
   To define following logbook hierarchy:
</p>
<p>
   <img src="hierarchy.gif">
</p>
<p>
   one would use following statements:
</p>
<ul>
   <li>
        <pre>
[global]
Group Linux PCs = Red Hat, Debian, Mandrake
Group Windows PCs = 98, ME, NT, XP, CE
Group CE = 1.0, 2.0
</pre>
   </li>
</ul>The logbook tabs would then look like this:
<p>
   <img src="tabs.gif">
</p>
<p>
   Where the selected group or logbook becomes blue. The lower
   groups/logbooks change according to the selected upper group. Please note
   that a logbook can be contained in more than one group, but then it
   should not be the first logbook in those groups. The colors of the tabs
   and the title bar can be specified in the CSS file.
</p>
<hr>
<div class="section">
   Top groups
</div>
<p>
   Sometimes groups of logbooks should be completely separate. Imagine two
   groups of logbooks, one for the engineering department and one for the
   administration department. These groups should have different
   administrators, and the logbook tabs at the top of the screen should not
   show the logbooks from the other department. Prior to ELOG version 2.4.1,
   one had to run two elogd servers in parallel, listening under different
   ports. Since 2.4.1, one can achieve the same behaviour using <code><b>Top
   groups</b></code>. The configuration could look like this:
</p>
<ul>
   <li>
        <pre>
Group Linux PCs = Red Hat, Debian, Mandrake
Group Windows PCs = 98, ME, NT, XP, CE
Group CE = 1.0, 2.UL

Top group engineering = Linux PCs, Windows PCs
Top group administration = Employees, Purchases

[global engineering]
Password file = engineers.pwd
Admin user = stefan

[global administration]
Password file = admin.pwd
Admin user = bill
</pre>
   </li>
</ul>Note that there can be a <b><code>[global]</code></b> section for each
top level group of logbooks. The rule is that a configuration setting in an
individual logbook section overrides a setting in the <b><code>[global
   &lt;top group&gt;]</code></b> setting, which by itsel overrides a setting
in the <b><code>[global]</code></b> section. This way one can define
settings for all top level groups (such as the SMTP host) in the
<b><code>[global]</code></b> section, and define different password files
and administrators in the individual top level group sections.<br>
<br>
If top groups are used, the root of the elogd server is not accessible any
more. Presume that elogd is accessible normally under
<b><code>http://your.host:8080/</code></b>, this URL becomes invalid for
top groups, to avoid the case that one group can "see" the logbooks of the
other groups. Instead, one has to append the top group name to the URL,
such as <b><code>http://your.host:8080/engineering</code></b> or
<b><code>http://your.host:8080/administration</code></b>. If someone does
not know the top group name, one cannot see the list of logbooks there, so
the groups become completely independent of each other. If this feature is
not wanted, it can be disabled by setting <code><b>Show top groups =
   1</b></code>.
<hr>
<div class="title">
   Individual logbook options
</div>
<p>
   For each logbook, there is a section with the logbook name in square
   brackets, so that each logbook can have different options. If an option
   is not present in a logbook section, then the system tries to locate that
   option in the <code><b>[global]</b></code> section. Thus if the following
   options are placed in the <code><b>[global]</b></code> section, they are
   defaults for all logbooks. If they are present in the
   <code><b>[global]</b></code> and in the logbook section, the logbook
   option is used.
</p>
<p>
   Here are the available options, by broad categories:
</p>
<p>
   <a name="general" id="general"></a>
</p>
<hr>
<div class="section">
   General options
</div>
<ul>
   <li>
      <b><code>Data dir = &lt;directory&gt;</code></b><br>
      This option is obsolete from version 2.2.5 on and should not be used.
      Use <code><b>Subdir = ...</b></code> instead.
   </li>
   <li>
      <b><code>Subdir = &lt;directory&gt;</code></b><br>
      Each logbook has a separate directory where the logbook entries are
      stored, which is controlled by this statement. If the directory does
      not exist, it is created autmatically by the <code><b>elogd</b></code>
      program. The subdirectory is relative to the logbook root directory
      specified with the <b><code>Logbook dir = ...</code></b> option. So if
      <code><b>Logbook dir = /usr/local/elog/logbooks</b></code> and
      <code><b>Subdir = Demo</b></code> then the logbook data is stored in
      <code><b>/user/local/elog/logbooks/Demo</b></code>. If the
      <b><code>Logbook dir = ...</code></b> option is not specified, then
      <b><code>logbooks</code></b> is used. If the subdirectory starts with a
      "/" ("\" under Windows), then it is used as an absolute path
      independent of the logbook dir. To see which directories are used,
      start <code><b>elogd</b></code> with the "-v" flag.
   </li>
   <li>
      <b><code>Comment = &lt;comment&gt;</code></b><br>
      The comment is displayed on the logbook selection list. The selection
      list is displayed if more than one logbook is defined on a host and no
      logbook is explicitly specified in the URL.
   </li>
   <li>
      <b><code>Theme = &lt;theme&gt;</code></b><br>
      A theme determines which layout and colors are used for a logbook,
      similar to <i>skins</i> in other programs. The <i>theme</i> option
      points to a subdirectory under the <i>"themes"</i> directory which
      resides in the resource directory. It contains all files for that
      theme. The format of these files is described under the <i>Themes</i>
      section.
   </li>
   <li>
      <b><code>CSS = &lt;filename&gt;</code></b><br>
      A given theme can contain several Cascading Style Sheets (CSS). This
      can be usefule if several logbooks use the same images and icons, but
      differnt colors. By default, the CSS <i>elog.css</i> is used. This
      statement adds an additional CSS, which can overwrite settings from
      <i>elog.css</i>. If different CSS'es should be used
      for different output media, this can be accomplished with a comma-
      separated list in the form
      <code><b>CSS = &lt;file1&gt;&amp;&lt;media1&gt;,&lt;file2&gt;&amp;&lt;media2&gt;</b></code>. This will then be translated into separate style sheet
      statements for the different media. For example a statement

      <code><b>CSS = default.css&amp;screen,print.css&amp;print</b></code>

      will result in the HTML statements:

      <pre>
  &lt;link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="default.css" media="screen"&gt;
  &lt;link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="print.css" media="print"&gt;
      </pre>
   </li>
   <li>
      <b><code>Title image = &lt;string&gt;</code></b><br>
      HTML code for the icon in the upper right corner. By default, following
      code is used:
      <p>
         &lt;img border=0 src="elog.gif" alt="ELOG logo"&gt;
      </p>
      <p>
         This code can be replaced by <b><code>&lt;string&gt;</code></b> to
         display a different icon file, or to display some text. The icon
         image has to be present in the theme directory, which is usually
         <b><code>&lt;elog root&gt;/themes/default</code></b>.
      </p>
   </li>
   <li>
      <b><code>Title image URL = &lt;URL&gt;</code></b><br>
      The ELOG icon at the right upper corner usually points to the ELOG home
      page. This URL can be changed to point to a corporate page for example
      with this option. The icon can be changed by replacing the
      <b><code>elog.gif</code></b> icon in the theme directory. This option
      should only be used if the <b><code>Title image</code></b> option is
      not used.
   </li>
   <li>
      <b><code>Time format = &lt;string&gt;</code></b><br>
      This option determines how the date and time of a logbook entry is
      displayed. The format of the string is the same as the C function
      <a href="strftime.txt">strftime</a>, so a string of <b>%A, %B %d, %Y,
      %H:%M</b> yields in a display of <b>Thursday, November 15, 2001,
      12:35</b> for example.
   </li>
   <li>
      <b><code>Time format &lt;attribute&gt; = &lt;string&gt;</code></b><br>
      Same, but just for an individual attribute.
   </li>
   <li>
      <b><code>Date format = &lt;string&gt;</code></b><br>
      This option determines how the date is displayed from attributes which
      are of type "date". The format of the string is the same as the C
      function <a href="strftime">strftime</a>, so a string of <b>%A, %B %d,
      %Y</b> yields in a display of <b>Thursday, November 15, 2001</b> for
      example.
   </li>
   <li>
      <b><code>Date format &lt;attribute&gt; = &lt;string&gt;</code></b><br>
      Same, but just for an individual attribute.
   </li>
   <li>
      <b><code>Welcome Page = &lt;file&gt;</code></b><br>
      By default, the list with the last twenty entries of a logbook is
      displayed when the logbook is selected. This can be overridden with
      this option, which causes a HTML file to be shown instead of the
      message list. This file can contain further links for new logbook
      messages of for logbook queries. Here is a simple example of such a
      file:
      <pre>
&lt;h1&gt;Welcome to the test logbook&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="?cmd=new"&gt;Enter&lt;/a&gt; a new message
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="?cmd=find"&gt;Search&lt;/a&gt; the logbook
&lt;/ul&gt;
</pre>The file must be present in the resource directory. Alternatively, an
      absolute path can be used if the file name starts with a
      <b><code>"/"</code></b> (Unix) or <b><code>"\"</code></b> or
      <b><code>"x:"</code></b> (Windows).
   </li>
   <li>
      <b><code>Start page = &lt;command&gt;</code></b><br>
      This option can be used to display a different start page.
      <b><code>command</code></b> can be either <i>0?cmd=Last</i> to display
      the last message, or any other ELog menu command in the form
      <b><code>?cmd=xxx</code></b>. To start with the search page, one uses
      <pre>
Start page = ?cmd=Find
</pre>Please note that if another language than English is selected via the <b>
      Language = xxx</b> option, the commands have to be in that language as
      well (like <i>"Start page = 0?cmd=Letzter"</i> for German).
   </li>
   <li>
      <b><code>Submit Page = &lt;file&gt;</code></b><br>
      This optional page can be displayed when a new message was submitted in
      a logbook. Here is an example:
      <pre>
&lt;h1&gt;You successfully submitted a message&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;a href="?cmd=Back"&gt;Back&lt;/a&gt; to the logbook&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a href="?cmd=New"&gt;Enter&lt;/a&gt; another message
</pre>The file must be present in the logbook directory. Alternatively, an
      absolute path can be used if the file name starts with a
      <b><code>"/"</code></b> (Unix) or <b><code>"\"</code></b> or
      <b><code>"x:"</code></b> (Windows).
   </li>
   <li>
      <b><code>Message comment = &lt;comment&gt;</code></b><br>
      This optional comment is displayed on top of the text entry field when
      submitting a new message. It can contain a sentence like "<i>Please
      enter your message here</i>:".
   </li>
   <li>
      <b><code>Reply comment = &lt;comment&gt;</code></b><br>
      This optional comment is displayed on top of the text entry field when
      replying to an exiting entry. It can contain a sentence like "<i>Please
      enter your reply here</i>:".
   </li>
   <li>
      <b><code>Attachment comment = &lt;comment&gt;</code></b><br>
      This optional comment is displayed on top of the attachment sumbission
      section when entering a new message. It can contain a sentence like
      "<i>Please upload your attachments here</i>:".
   </li>
   <li>
      <b><code>Menu commands = &lt;list&gt;</code></b><br>
      This option specifies the menu commands displayed on top of a single
      logbook page. For certain installations, it can be useful to disable
      some commands. Following commands are possible:
      <ul>
         <li>
            <b>New</b> - Enter new logbook entry
         </li>
         <li>
            <b>Edit</b> - Edit current logbook entry
         </li>
         <li>
            <b>Delete</b> - Delete current logbook entry
         </li>
         <li>
            <b>Reply</b> - Submit a reply to current entry
         </li>
         <li>
            <b>Duplicate</b> - Duplicate the current entry with the possibility
            to change some values
         </li>
         <li>
            <b>Download</b> - Download a message in ASCII format
         </li>
         <li>
            <b>Find</b> - Search entries in logbooks
         </li>
         <li>
            <b>Last day</b> - Display entries from last day
         </li>
         <li>
            <b>Move to</b> - Move entry to other logbook
         </li>
         <li>
            <b>Copy to</b> - Copy entry to other logbook
         </li>
         <li>
            <b>Config</b> - Edit elogd.cfg (if <b>no</b> "<i>Password file</i>"
            is given)
         </li>
         <li>
            <b>Config</b> - Modify/Add user accounts (if "<i>Password file</i>"
            is given)
         </li>
         <li>
            <b>Admin</b> - Edit elogd.cfg (if "<i>Password file</i>" is given)
         </li>
         <li>
            <b>Login</b> - Login with user name and password (if "<i>Password
            file</i>" is given)
         </li>
         <li>
            <b>Import</b> - Show CSV (comma-separated-values) import page
         </li>
         <li>
            <b>Logout</b> - Logout current user (if "<i>Password file</i>" is
            given)
         </li>
         <li>
            <b>Help</b> - General help
         </li>
      </ul><br>
      <br>
      The commands are always in English, independent of the
      <code><b>language = ...</b></code> setting, and are automatically
      translated into the specified language.<br>
      <br>
      If this option is not present, following default is used:<br>
      <pre>
Menu commands = List, New, Edit, Delete, Reply, Duplicate, Find, Config, Help
</pre><br>
   </li>
   <li>
      <b><code>Copy to = &lt;logbook list&gt;</code></b>
   </li>
   <li>
      <b><code>Move to = &lt;logbook list&gt;</code></b><br>
      The commands <code><b>Copy to</b></code> and <code><b>Move
      to</b></code> make it possible to copy or move a logbook entry from one
      logbook to another. By default, all logbooks except the current logbook
      are shown as a possible destination. With the configurations options
      <b><code>Copy to = &lt;logbook list&gt;</code></b> and <b><code>Move to
      = &lt;logbook list&gt;</code></b> it is possible to specify a list of
      destination logbooks, separated by commata. This can make sense if only
      certain logbooks make sense as destinations. The flag <code><b>Preserve IDs</b></code>
      can be used to keep the entry ID in the destination logbook.
   </li>
   <li>
      <b><code>List Menu commands = &lt;list&gt;</code></b><br>
      This option specifies the menu commands displayed on top of the listing
      page. Although all commands from a above are possible, only the
      commands <code><b>New, Find, Select, Import, Config, Admin, Change
      password, Logout</b></code> and <code><b>Help</b></code> make sense.
      The command <code><b>Select</b></code> can be used to select multiple
      messages for deletion or for moving to other logbooks. Once the
      <code><b>Select</b></code> command is clicked, check boxes appear in
      front of all entries which let the user select one or more entries. A
      new menu bar shows up with a <code><b>Delete</b></code> and optionally
      a <code><b>Coyp to ...</b></code> and <code><b>Move to ...</b></code>
      button, if these commands are present in the <code><b>Menu
      commands</b></code> list. Pressing one of these buttons deletes, copies
      or moves all selected logbook entries.
   </li>
   <li>
      <b><code>Guest Menu commands = &lt;list&gt;</code></b><br>
      This option specifies the menu commands for guest logins. A guest login
      happens if a password file is used, but someone accesses the logbook
      for the first time, which means that no username/password is given. In
      that case the commands from the guest menu are displayed, which usually
      contain a subset of the normal commands. A typical scenario is a
      logbook which only has commands to read the logbook on the guest menu,
      but no commands to write/edit entries. Instead, the <b>login</b>
      command is given in the guest menu, with which one can login as a real
      user (username and password have to match those from the password
      file), which then allowes full access via the <b>"Menu commands"</b>
      list. A typical example for the menu settings for this scenario are:
      <pre>
Menu commands = List, New, Edit, Reply, Duplicate, Find, Config, Logout, Help
Guest menu commands = List, Find, Login, Help
</pre>
      <p>
         Note that the presence of this option opens user access also to the
         find result or elog listing page, which usually contains some config
         command. So it is useful to combine the <code><b>Guest menu
         commands</b></code> option with the following <code><b>Guest List
         Menu commands</b></code> option to restrict the access to the find
         result page as well.
      </p>
   </li>
   <li>
      <b><code>Guest List Menu commands = &lt;list&gt;</code></b><br>
      Same as <b>Guest Menu commands</b> but for the find result page.
   </li>
   <li>
      <b><code>Menu text = &lt;file&gt;</code></b><br>
      If this option is present, and additional menu row above the message
      gets displayed with the contents of &lt;file&gt;. This file can contain
      arbitrary text, images or links. One example would be following text to
      go back to the listing page and display the next <i>Routine</i> entry
      and all <i>Routine</i> entries:<br>
      <pre>
&lt;small&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="?cmd=next&amp;type=Routine"&gt;Next Routine entry&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;|
&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="../?Type=Routine"&gt;All Routine entries&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/small&gt;
</pre>
   </li>
   <li>
      <b><code>List Menu text = &lt;file&gt;</code></b><br>
      The same for the list page. One example would be following text to
      switch between the different display modi:<br>
   </li>
   <li>
      <b><code>Filter Menu text = &lt;file&gt;</code></b><br>
      The same for the filter line in the list page.<br>
   </li>
   <li>
      <b><code>Guest Display = &lt;list&gt;</code></b><br>
      This option specifies which attributes are displayed on guest access.
      It is possible to display only a subset of all attributes for guest
      access, but the full list if someone is logged in (using the option
      "Password file"). The <code><b>list</b></code> consists of comma
      separated attributes, including the word <i>text</i>, if one wants to
      display the entry body text for guests.
      <pre>
&lt;small&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="?mode=summary"&gt;Summary&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;|
&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="?mode=full"&gt;Full&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;|
&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="?mode=threaded"&gt;Threaded&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;|
&lt;/small&gt;
</pre>
   </li>
   <li>
      <code><b>Top text = &lt;file&gt; | &lt;string&gt;</b></code><br>
      The text of this option gets displayed at the top of every Elog page.
      It can be a string or a filename which gets displayed. Might be useful
      to display company logos etc.
      If a file is specified, it must be present in the logbook directory.
      Alternatively, an absolute path can be used if the file name starts
      with a <b><code>"/"</code></b> (Unix) or <b><code>"\"</code></b> or
      <b><code>"x:"</code></b> (Windows).
   </li>
   <li>
      <b><code>Bottom text = &lt;file&gt; | &lt;string&gt;</code></b><br>
      The text of this option gets displayed at the bottom of every Elog page
      instead of the little Elog home page link. It can be a string or a
      file. It can contain for example a link back to the main logbook
      selection page like:
      <pre>
&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="/"&gt;Main page&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
</pre>Or it can contain other useful links. If a file is specified, it must be
      present in the logbook directory. Alternatively, an absolute path can be used
      if the file name starts with a <b><code>"/"</code></b> (Unix) or <b><code>
      "\"</code></b> or <b><code>"x:"</code></b> (Windows).
   </li>
   <li>
      <b><code>Bottom text login = &lt;file&gt; | &lt;string&gt;</code></b><br>
      The same as <b><code>Bottom text</code></b> but for the login page. This
      allows to display a different text at the bottom of the login page. It
      can also be used to execute some JavaScript.
   </li>
   <li>
      <b><code>Help URL = &lt;URL&gt;</code></b><br>
      This URL is used for the Help button. By default, the file
      <b>eloghelp_xx.html</b> is returned with the contents of the help page.
      Edit this file directly to add site-specific help for all logbooks.
      Alternatively, use the <b><code>Help URL</code></b> option to specify
      different help pages for different logbooks. It can point to a
      site-specific help page via <b><code>http://...</code></b> or to a
      local file like <b><code>file://c:/tmp/config.html</code></b>, or to
      the name of an HTML file which must be present in the resource
      directory.
   </li>
   <li>
      <b><code>Message Width = &lt;number&gt;</code></b><br>
      This value sets the number of characters per line of the main message
      entry field. The default value is 76 (78 for replies), and can be
      increased for installations which need a larger window size (like
      pasting log files etc.). If both <code><b>Message Width</b></code>
      and <code><b>Message Height</b></code> are not given, some JavaScript
      code is used which automatically resizes the message window
      dynamically to fit optimally into the browser window.
   </li>
   <li>
      <b><code>Message Height = &lt;number&gt;</code></b><br>
      This value sets the number of lines of the main message entry field.
      The default value is 20, and can be changed for installations which
      need a different window size. If both <code><b>Message Width</b></code>
      and <code><b>Message Height</b></code> are not given, some JavaScript
      code is used which automatically resizes the message window
      dynamically to fit optimally into the browser window.
   </li>
   <li>
      <b><code>Admin textarea = &lt;cols&gt;,&lt;rows&gt;</code></b><br>
      This defines the textarea size for the admin page. Default is
      <b>80,40</b>.
   </li>
   <li>
      <b><code>Display mode = [full|summary|threaded]</code></b><br>
      Default mode for search display. On the find entry form, the checkboxes
      are set accordingly. The "Last xxx" page uses this setting directly.
   </li>
   <li>
      <b><code>Entries per page = &lt;number&gt;</code></b><br>
      Number of logbook entries displayed per page in a search result. The
      default is 20.
   </li>
   <li>
      <b><code>Restrict edit time = &lt;hours&gt;</code></b><br>
      If this option is set, a new message can only be edited a certain
      number of hours after its creation. This can be useful if one wants to
      ensure that old entries cannot be modified. Hours can also be
      fractional, like 0.5 for 30 min.
   </li>
   <li>
      <b><code>Max content length = &lt;bytes&gt;</code></b><br>
      This option restricts the size of attachments. When very large
      (&gt;100MB) attachments are uploaded, the elogd server can be busy with
      this upload for a longer time and not respond to other requests during
      that time. To avoid this, the maximum size of attachments can be
      restricted. The server will then refuse to accept larger attachments.
      The default is 10485760 (= 10 MB). This option has to be placed into
      the [global] section and the elogd server has to be restarted after a
      change.
   </li>
   <li>
      <b><code>Fonts = &lt;list&gt;</code></b><br>
      List of fonts (comma separated) to be shown in the font drop-down box
      of the entry edit form. Default is<br>
      <br>
      <code>Fonts = Arial, Comic Sans MS, Courier New, Tahoma, Times New
         Roman, Verdana</code><br>
      <br>
      On Unix systems some of these fonts might not be installed, in which
      case they can be replaced by others like <b>Serif</b>,
      <b>Sans-serif</b>, <b>Helvetica</b>.
   </li>
   <li>
      <b><code>All display limit = &lt;n&gt;</code></b><br>
      If a logbook contains many entries, the list gets divided into pages,
      with some page navigation for the next, previous, a specific page and
      all pages. If the logbook contains a large number of entries (>500),
      the display of all thes entries can take very long and might slow down
      the elogd server, especially if the entries are not displayed in
      "summary" mode but in "full" mode. Therefore the "All" link should not
      be used in the page navigation for large logbooks. The number of
      entries from when on the "All" link gets hidden can be specified with
      this number, the default value is <b><code>500</code></b>.
   </li>
   <li>
      <b><code>Thumbnail size = &lt;size&gt;</code></b><br>
      This option determines the default thumbnail size. To make the
      automatic generation of thumbnails working, the ImageMagick package
      has to be installed. Refer to the <a href="adminguilde.html#imagemagick">
      admin guide</a> for installation instructions. The thumbnail size
      <b><code>size</code></b> gets passed to the <b><code>-thumbnail</code></b>
      option of the conversion. A value of <b><code>300</code></b> converts
      all pictures to thumbnails 300 pixels wide. A value of
      <b><code>300&gt;</code></b> converts all pictures to thumbnails 300
      pixels wide if they are larger than 300 pixels initially, and leaves
      them untouched if they are smaller. A value of <b><code>10%</code></b>
      converts all pictures to 10% of their original size. If the
      thumbnail size option is missing, the thumbnails will be created
      with the original image size, and can then be resized and rotated
      interactively with the image manipulation buttons:<p>

      <img src="thumbnail.png"><p>

      Setting <b><code>Thumbnail size = 0</code></b> turns off the thumbnail
      creation.<p>
   </li>
   <li>
      <b><code>Thumbnail options = &lt;options&gt;</code></b><br>
      With this option one can pass additional parameters to the ImageMagick
      package. They are passes 1:1 to the <b>convert</b> program. Commonly
      used is the <b>-density</b> option to increase the image quality when
      converting from PDF or EPS files.<p>

<ul>
   <li>
      <b><code>Attributes = &lt;list&gt;</code></b><br>
      Define a number of attributes for the logbook, separated by commata. A
      maximum of 100 attributes can be defined. Typical values are
      "<i>Author</i>", "<i>Subject</i>" or "<i>Type</i>". Following values
      are not allowed:<p>
      <ul>
         <li>Text
         <li>Date
         <li>Encoding
         <li>Reply to
         <li>In reply to
         <li>Locked by
         <li>Attachment
      </ul><p>
      since these are used internally by elog.
   </li>
   <li>
      <b><code>Options &lt;attribute&gt; = &lt;list&gt;</code></b><br>
      Usually, an text field is used for an attribute, where the user can
      fill in text of up to 100 characters. If instead a drop-down box with
      preset items is better for a given attribute, these items can be
      defined with this statement. Up to 100 items can be defined, separated
      by commas. To add an option including a comma, encose it in quotations
      marks like
      <pre>
Options town = San Francisco, "Paris, Texas", "Paris, France"
</pre>
   </li>
   <li>
      <b><code>Extendable options = &lt;list&gt;</code></b><br>
      When using the <code><b>Options &lt;attribute&gt;</b></code> to specify
      a list of possible options, this list is fixed. Sometimes it is
      desirable to extend the list when a new entry in a logbook is made and
      a certain option is missing on the list. By adding the attribute name
      to the <code><b>Extandable options</b></code> list, a button appears
      next to the attribute in the message entry form which lets you add new
      options to the list. The elogd.cfg configuration file is then
      automatically updated. When a new logbook entry gets made, the new
      option automatically appears in the drop-down box for that attribute.
   </li>
   <li>
      <b><code>ROptions &lt;attribute&gt; = &lt;list&gt;</code></b><br>
      Same as <code><b>Options</b></code> above, but using radio buttons
      instead of a drop-down box.
   </li>
   <li>
      <b><code>MOptions &lt;attribute&gt; = &lt;list&gt;</code></b><br>
      This list allows for "<i>Multiple Options</i>", meaning that an
      attribute can have several values simultaneously. When entering an
      entry with MOptions, each value from the list is represented by a
      checkbox. Unlike with normal options, multiple checkboxes can be
      checked for an entry. The attribue value then becomes
      <pre>
&lt;value1&gt; | &lt;value2&gt; | ...
</pre>In the "<i>find</i>" page only one of these values can be specified,
      which is then treated as a substring in the search filter.
   </li>
   <li>
      <b><code>IOptions &lt;attribute&gt; = &lt;list&gt;</code></b><br>
      This list specifies a set of icons for an attribute. Some icons are
      contained in the <i>themes/default/icons</i> directory which can be
      used here like
      <pre>
Attributes = Author, Icon, Subject...
IOptions Icon = icon1.gif, icon2.gif, icon3.gif, ...
</pre>New icons are welcome and should be sent back to the author to be
      incorporated in the next version.
   </li>
   <li>
      <b><code>Comment &lt;attribute&gt; = &lt;comment&gt;</code></b><br>
      Optional comment which is displayed below the attribute name in the
      entry form. Can be used to explain the attribute somehow.
   </li>
   <li>
      <b><code>Tooltip &lt;attribute&gt; = &lt;comment&gt;</code></b><br>
      Same as <code><b>Comment &lt;attribute&gt;</b></code>, except that the
      comment gets displayed as a tooltip (tiny pup-up window) when the user
      moves the mouse cursor over the attribute name in the entry form.
   </li>
   <li>
      <b><code>Tooltip &lt;attribute&gt; &lt;attribute option&gt; = &lt;comment&gt;</code></b><br>
      Same as <code><b>Tooltip &lt;attribute&gt;</b></code>, but for option
      values of a <code><b>MOptions</b></code> attribute. Using this option,
      a different tooltip can be shown above each check box of an optional
      value for an attribute. Please note that attributes or options with
      spaces should <b>not</b> be enclosed with quotes.
   </li>
   <li>
      <b><code>Icon comment &lt;icon&gt; = &lt;comment&gt;</code></b><br>
      Icons may contain a comment, which is then used in email notifications
      instead of the icon file name. One has to add a separate icon comment
      for each icon file.
   </li>
   <li>
      <b><code>Options &lt;attribute&gt; = boolean</code></b><br>
      If an attribute is marked "<i>boolean</i>" this way, a checkbox is
      displayed for this attribute.
   </li>
   <li>
      <b><code>Preset &lt;attribute&gt; = &lt;string&gt;</code></b><br>
      This option uses a preset string for an attribute. The string can
      contain subsitutions like the ones described under the "<i>Subst
      &lt;attribute&gt;</i>" command. One possible application is to use the
      login name for the author field like:
      <pre>
Preset Author = $long_name
</pre>If the attribute should be locked at the Web submission, use the
      "<i>Locked Attributes = ...</i>" option. If a preset value is given for an
      attribute which has an options list, the preset value is selected in the drop
      down box by default.<br>
      <br>
   </li>
   <li>
      <b><code>Preset text = &lt;string&gt; or &lt;file&gt;</code></b><br>
      This preset value is used for the main body text. It can be a string or
      a file, which must be present in the logbook directory. Alternatively,
      an absolute path can be used if the file name starts with a
      <b><code>"/"</code></b> (Unix) or <b><code>"\"</code></b> or
      <b><code>"x:"</code></b> (Windows).
   </li>
   <li>
      <b><code>Preset on edit &lt;attribute&gt; =
         &lt;string&gt;</code></b><br>
      Same as <b><code>Preset &lt;attribute&gt;</code></b>, but evaluated when
      editing existing entries.
   </li>
   <li>
      <b><code>Preset on reply &lt;attribute&gt; =
         &lt;string&gt;</code></b><br>
      Same as <b><code>Preset &lt;attribute&gt;</code></b>, but evaluated for
      replies.
   </li>
   <li>
      <b><code>Preset on first reply &lt;attribute&gt; =
         &lt;string&gt;</code></b><br>
      While <b><code>Preset on reply &lt;attribute&gt;</code></b>, is
      evaluated for any replies, this one is only executed for the first
      reply to an entry. It can be useful for example to so do something
      like this:
      <pre>
Preset on first reply Subject = Re: $Subject
</pre>
      So the "Re:" only gets added once, and you don't get long chains of
      "Re: Re: Re: ....".
   </li>
   <li>
      <b><code>Preset on duplicate &lt;attribute&gt; =
         &lt;string&gt;</code></b><br>
      Same as <b><code>Preset &lt;attribute&gt;</code></b>, but evaluated for
      duplicted entries.
   </li>
   <li>
      <b><code>Locked Attributes = &lt;list&gt;</code></b><br>
      The attributes specified here cannot be modified when a new entry is
      submitted. This makes only sense for preset attributes.
   </li>
   <li>
      <b><code>Fixed Attributes Edit = &lt;list&gt;</code></b><br>
      The attributes specified here cannot be modified when an existing entry
      is modified via the <b><code>Edit</code></b> button. This feature can
      be useful to preserve the original author of the message, when using
      the <b><code>Preset Author = $long_name</code></b> option as described
      above.
   </li>
   <li>
      <b><code>Fixed Attributes Reply = &lt;list&gt;</code></b><br>
      The attributes specified here cannot be modified when an existing entry
      is replied on via the <b><code>Reply</code></b> button. This feature
      can be useful to preserve the original subject of a message for
      example.
   </li>
   <li>
      <b><code>Required Attributes = &lt;list&gt;</code></b><br>
      The attributes specified here are required when a new entry is
      submitted. The attribute names are marked with <font color=
                                                                   "red">*</font> on the entry form.
   </li>
   <li>
      <b><code>Show Attributes = &lt;list&gt;</code></b><br>
      Attributes present in this list are shown in the single entry page.
      Omitting attributes can make sense for attributes which are
      automatically derived from other attributes via the
      <b><code>Change &lt;attribute&gt;</code></b> command.
   </li>
   <li>
      <b><code>Show Attributes Edit = &lt;list&gt;</code></b><br>
      The same as <b><code>Show Attributes</code></b>, but for the entry form.
   </li>
   <li>
      <b><code>Propagate Attributes = &lt;list&gt;</code></b><br>
      With this option, changed in an attribute are autmatically propagated
      to all entries of a thread. This can be useful if one has an attribute
      "problem status" for example with the options "open",
      "under investigation", "fixed". A thread related to a specific problem
      can then have several replies. If the problem gets fixed, a new
      reply can be made with the attribute "problem status" being "fixed", and
      then the propagation causes all entries of this thread to become "fixed".
   </li>
   <li>
      <b><code>Page title = &lt;string&gt;</code></b><br>
      The string specified here is used for the title of the web page. It is
      also used by most browsers for bookmark names. The string can contain
      substitutions as described unter the "<i>Subst &lt;attribute&gt;</i>"
      option.
   </li>
   <li>
      <b><code>Edit Page title = &lt;string&gt;</code></b><br>
      The string specified here is used for the title of the entry form. It
      is also used by most browsers for bookmark names. The string can
      contain substitutions as described unter the "<i>Subst
      &lt;attribute&gt;</i>" option.
   </li>
   <li>
      <b><code>List display = &lt;list&gt;</code></b><br>
      Specified the display and order of items in a message listing page or a
      search result page. In addition to all attributes, following items can
      be specified:<br>
      <br>
      <ul>
         <li>
            <b><code>ID</code></b> for the entry ID
         </li>
         <li>
            <b><code>Date</code></b> for the entry date/time
         </li>
         <li>
            <b><code>Edit</code></b> to display a column with an edit icon to
            directly edit and entry
         </li>
         <li>
            <b><code>Delete</code></b> to display a column with a delete icon
            to directly delete and entry
         </li>
      </ul><br>
      The restriction to certain attributes can be helpful if many attributes
      are defined in a logbook, which usually makes the table too big to fit
      in the browser. The default is<br>
      <pre>
List display = ID, Date, &lt;all attributs&gt;
</pre>Which displays the message number, date, and all attributes. The display
      of the message body is controlled by the <b><code>Display mode</code></b> and
      <b><code>Summary lines</code></b> options. If a search goes over "all
      logbooks", an additional colums with the logbook name of each entry is added in
      front.
   </li>
   <li>
      <b><code>Guest List display = &lt;list&gt;</code></b><br>
      Same as <code><b>List display</b></code>, but for guest access (user
      level access with password, but not logged in). Please see also
      <code><b>Guest display</b></code>. In addition to <code><b>List
      display</b></code>, one can optionally specify <code><b>Text</b></code>
      as an attribute here. Without that attribute, the summary text of the
      entry body is not shown. This makes it possible to show the text for
      registered users and hide it for guest access.
   </li>
   <li>
      <b><code>Link display = &lt;list&gt;</code></b><br>
      Normally, each column in the display list contains a link to the
      individual entry. If this is not desired, the list of attributes with
      links can be restricted to only a subset with this option.
   </li>
   <li>
      <b><code>Thread display = &lt;string&gt;</code></b><br>
      Optional way to specify the line contents in the threaded search
      result. Following substitutions are possible:
      <ul>
         <li>
            <b>$&lt;attribute&gt;</b>: The value of the attribute
         </li>
         <li>
            <b>$logbook</b>: The name of the current logbook
         </li>
         <li>
            <b>$entry time</b>: The message date and time, formatted via
            "<i>Time format</i>"
         </li>
         <li>
            <b>$message id</b>: The message ID
         </li>
      </ul><br>
      A typical example would be<br>
      <pre>
Thread display = $subject, posted by $author on $entry time
</pre>
   </li>
   <li>
      <b><code>Thread icon = &lt;attribute&gt;</code></b><br>
      If a logbook uses some icons for an attribute, these icons can be
      displayed in the search result page instead of the default icons
      contained in the themes directory.
   </li>
   <li>
      <b><code>RSS Title = &lt;string&gt;</code></b><br>
      ELOG supports so-called <i>RSS feeds</i>. Once can subscribe to new
      logbook entries with RSS readers such as Mozilla Firefox. Once new
      entries are submitted to the logbook, the become visible in the
      subscripition. By default, all attributes of the last 15 logbook
      entries are used as the RSS title. With this option once can changed
      this behaviour. Following substitutions are possible:
      <ul>
         <li>
            <b>$&lt;attribute&gt;</b>: The value of the attribute
         </li>

         <li>
            <b>$entry time</b>: The message date and time, formatted via
            "<i>Time format</i>"
         </li>
         <li>
            <b>$message id</b>: The message ID
         </li>
      </ul><br>
      A typical example would be<br>
      <pre>
RSS Title = $subject, posted by $author on $entry time
</pre>
   </li>
   <li>
      <b><code>RSS Entries = &lt;n&gt;</code></b><br>
      Number of entries to be shown in the RSS feed. Default is 15.
   </li>
   <li>
      <b><code>Subst &lt;attribute&gt; = &lt;string&gt;</code></b><br>
      When submitting logbook entries, attribute values can be substituted by
      some text. This text can contain arbitrary fixed text and following
      values:
      <ul>
         <li>
            <b>$&lt;attribute&gt;</b>: The entered value of the attribute

      Following example use this feature to add the remote host name to the
      author:<br>
      <pre>
Subst Author = $author from $remote_host
</pre><br>
      Following example substitutes an attribute with the contents of a

      <pre>
  Subst Info = $shell(cat /tmp/filename)              (Unix)
  Subst Info = $shell(type c:\tmp\filename)           (Windows)
</pre>
      <br>
      A special option are automatically generated tags, which are
      automatically incremented for each new message. This is achieved by
      putting #'s into the substitution string, which is used as a placeholder for
      the incrementing index. Each "#" stands for one digit, thus the
      statement
      <pre>
Subst Number = XYZ-#####
</pre>results in automatically created attributes <i>"Number"</i> of the form
      <pre>
XYZ-00001
XYZ-00002
XYZ-00003
</pre>and so on. In addition to the #'s one may specify format specifiers which
      are passed to the <a href="strftime.txt">
      strftime</a> function. This allows to create tags wich contain the
      current year, month and so on. Once the date part of the attribute
      changes, the index restarts from one. The statement
      <pre>
Subst Number = XYZ-%Y-%b-###
</pre>results in automatically created attributes <i>"Number"</i> of the form
      <pre>
XYZ-2005-Oct-001
XYZ-2005-Oct-002
XYZ-2005-Oct-003</pre>
      <br>
      and
      <br>
      <pre>
XYZ-2005-Nov-001
XYZ-2005-Nov-002</pre>
      <br>
      on the next month.

   </li>
   <li>
      <b><code>Remove on reply = &lt;list&gt;</code></b><br>
      This option clears one or more (separated by commata) attribute values
      from a logbook entry when creating a reply to that entry. This can make
      sense for example for the author, since the author of a reply can be
      different from the original author.
   </li>
   <li>
      <b><code>Quote on reply = 0 | 1</code></b><br>
      This flag controls if the original text is quoted in a reply. Default
      is <b>1</b>
   </li>
   <li>
      <b><code>Reply string = &lt;string&gt;</code></b><br>
      String used to mark original message lines. Default is <b><code>"&gt;

      desired.
   </li>
   <li>
      <b><code>Subst on reply &lt;attribute &gt; =
         &lt;string&gt;</code></b><br>
      Substitution of attributes for replies. This option can be used to
      replace the current subject with a "Re: &lt;old subject&gt;":<br>
      <pre>
Subst on reply subject = Re: $subject
</pre>
      Note that this option works only for the first reply. So a
      reply-to-a-reply would still have <b>Re: &lt;old subject&gt;</b>
      and not <b>Re: Re: &lt;old subject&gt;</b>. If you want the substitution
      for all replies, please use <code><b>Preset on reply</b></code> instead.
   </li>
   <li>
      <b><code>Subst on edit &lt;attribute &gt; =
         &lt;string&gt;</code></b><br>
      Substitution of attributes for edited messages. This option can be used
      to replace the author by the current author for example:<br>
      <pre>
Subst on edit author = $full_name
</pre>

   <li>
      <b><code>Quick filter = &lt;list&gt;</code></b><br>
      Specifies list of comma separated attributes for which a drop-down
      filter is displayed in the search result page. By selecting a value
      from that drop-down box, only entries with that value are displayed. In
      addition to all attributes defined in the <b><code>Attributes
      =</code></b> list, the attribute <b><code>Date</code></b> and the
      option <b><code>Subtext</code></b> can be listed here. Using the
      <b><code>Date</code></b> filter, the last day, week, month and so on
      can be displayed. The <b><code>Subtext</code></b> filter works on the
      entry body text.
   </li>

   <li>
      <b><code>Last default = &lt;n&gt;</code></b><br>
      Some logbooks are very big ans searching through all entries with
      quick filter can be time consuming. This option sets a default value
      for the <code><b>Date</b></code> quick filter, so that by default
      only the &lt;n&gt; days are displayed.
   </li>

      Optional formatting parameters for attributes. Following items can be
      defined in the comma-separated list:
      <p>
         Values used for single message display page:
      </p>
      <ul>

            <b>&lt;css_class_name&gt;</b>,<b>&lt;css_class_value&gt;</b>
            Cascading Style Sheet class names used for cells containing
            attribute name or value, respectively. The classes must be defined
            in the style sheet file (usually

   <li>
      <code><b>Type &lt;attribute&gt; = date | datetime | numeric |
         userlist | useremail | muserlist | museremail</b></code><br>
      A normal attribute can contain strings of any type. With this option,
      attributes can be forced to be numeric or to be a date/time, or to
      consist of a list of all users from the password file. When new logbook
      entries are made, numeric attributes are checked to contain only
      digits. Note that JavaScript has to be enabled to do this.<br>
      <br>
      Attributes of type <b><code>date</code></b> are treated as a date.
      Their format for display can be controlled by the <b><code>Date
      format</code></b> option. Upon entry, drop-down boxes are displayed
      which let the user select the day, month and year. Alternatively, a
      pop-up date picker using a calendar can be displayed if JavaScript is
      enabled. Date attributes are saved internally as seconds since
      1.1.1970, and can therefore be sorted propoerly by clicking on the
      header of a logbook entry list. On the find page, dates can be searched
      for via a start and end date. If date attributes are used in a quick
      filter (see above), a drop-down quick filter box is displayed which
      lets the user select "last day", "last week", "next week", and so on.
      The <b><code>datetime</code></b> type combines a date and time in
      HH:MM. The output of this combination is controlled by the
      <b><code>Time format</code></b> option.<br>
      <br>
      If the attribute type is <b><code>userlist</code></b>, a drop-down box
      is displayed which contains all user names from the current password
      file. This can be useful for example in a bug tracking system, where a
      new entry gets assigned to an individual. The type
      <b><code>useremail</code></b> is similar, just a list of email addresses
      of all registered users. This can be used to send email notification
      to assigned people by using this attribute in an
      <b><code>Email all = &lt;attribute&gt;</code></b> statement. The type
      <b><code>muserlist</code></b> and <b><code>museremail</code></b> are the
      same that <b><code>userlist</code></b> and <b><code>useremail</code></b>,
      except that several user names or user emails can be selected at once
      using check boxes.
   </li>
   <li>
      <b><code>Style &lt;attribute&gt; &lt;value&gt; = &lt;style&gt;</code></b><br>

      Optional formatting of logbok entries in list mode. For some logbooks
      it might be useful to display different entries in a different color
      for example. To achieve this, a CSS style sheet can be attached to an
      entry based on the value of an attribute. If you have an attribute
      called <code><b>importnace</b></code> and you want to highlight
      all entries where <code><b>importnace</b></code> is <code><b>severe</b></code>
      for example, you can specify following style:
      <pre>
Style importance severe = background-color:red
        </pre>
      For possible formattings, please refer to some CSS documentation. You can
      change the colors, font styles and sizes. The style is then valid for the
      whole row of that entry.<br />
      <br />
      For empty attributes one can specify "", such as
      <pre>
Style importance "" = background-color:red
        </pre>
   </li>
   <li>
      <b><code>Cell Style &lt;attribute&gt; &lt;value&gt; = &lt;style&gt;</code></b><br>

      Same as above, but only for a specific cell containing &lt;attribute&gt;.
      Following options
      <pre>
Attributes = Author, Status
Options Status = Fixed, Under Process, Not Fixed
Cell Style Status Fixed  = background-color:green
Cell Style Status Not Fixed  = background-color:red
Cell Style Status Under Process  = background-color:yellow
        </pre>
      for example produce following listing:<br>
      <p><img border=0 src="cell_style.png"></p>
   </li>
   <li>
      <code><b>Change &lt;attribute&gt; = &lt;string&gt;</b></code><br>
      Instead of subsituting an attribute, the original attribute can be kept
      and just the output formatting can be changed. This can be very handy
      for constructing HTML links out of attributes. Presume that a company
      has a telephone book reachable under<br>
      <br>
      <pre>
http://any.company.com/telbook.cgi?search=&lt;name&gt;
</pre>where &lt;name&gt; has to be replaced by a search string. Now one can
      construct an automatic telephonebook lookup with following options:<br>
      <pre>
Attributes = Name, Telephone, ...
Display Telephone = &lt;a href="http://any.company.com/telbook.cgi?search=$Name"&gt;$Name's telephone number&lt;/a&gt;
</pre>The attribute <b><code>Telephone</code></b> is now automatically
      constructed from the attribute <b><code>Name</code></b> and consists of a link
      to the company's telephonebook. The advantage of this system is if the URL of
      the telephonebook changes one day, only one statement in the config file has to
      be changed, while otherways (like with the <b><code>Subst Telephone =
      ...</code></b> option) all entries would have to be changed manually.
   </li>
   <li>
      <code><b>List Change &lt;attribute&gt; = &lt;string&gt;</b></code><br>
      Same option for the list display.
   </li>
   <li>
      <code><b>Execute new | edit | delete = &lt;command&gt;</b></code><br>
      It is possible to execute a shell command on the server side after a
      new message has been submitted, edited or deleted. This feature has
      been used in the past for SMS notifications over a telephone system and
      for synchrnonization of the ELOG database with an external SQL
      database. The <b><code>&lt;command&gt;</code></b> can contain
      substitutions similar to the <b><code>Subst</code></b> command. In
      addition the list of all attachments can be referred to via
      <b><code>$&lt;attachments&gt;</code></b>. The text body of the entry
      can be referred to with <b><code>$text</code></b>. It should
      be noted that only the first 1500 characters of the text can be used,
      in order not to exceed the limits of the shell. Following (Unix) command
      writes a notification into some file:
      <pre>
Execute new = echo "New message wiht ID $message id of type $type from $long_name on $remote_host" &gt;&gt; /tmp/elog.log
</pre><br>
      It should be noted that this feature can impose a security problem. If
      someone can edit the elogd.cfg through the <b><code>Config</code></b>
      command of elogd, that person can put malicious code into elogd.cfg and
      execute it. This is even more severe if elogd runs with root
      privileges. To avoid such problems, the execute facility is disabled in
      elogd by default and has to be enabled explicitly with the "-x" command
      line flag. The administrator has to ensure then of course that only
      trusted people can edit elogd.cfg.
   </li>
   <li>
      <code><b>Last submission = &lt;string&gt;</b></code><br>
      This option determines what gets displayed on the logbook selection
      page in the <i>Last submission</i> colum. The default string is
      <code><b>$entry time by $author</b></code>. If a logbook does not
      contain an <code><b>author</b></code> attribute, another string can be
      chosen.
   </li>
   <li>
      <code><b>ID display = &lt;string&gt;</b></code><br>
      This option determines the display of the entry ID. In some
      applications, the entry ID can be used as a tag, containing more than
      just the ID number. For example
      <ul>
         <li>
            <pre>
ID display = TAG-$message id
</pre>
         </li>
      </ul>would display the entry ID as "TAG-1","TAG-2", ... and so on.
   </li>
   <li>
      <b><code>Prepend on reply = &lt;string&gt;</code></b><br>
      With this option a string can be placed on top of a reply. Using string
      substition, this can be useful for adding the author and the date of a
      reply, like<br>
      <br>
      <b><code>Prepend on reply = Added $date by
         $long_name\n\n</code></b><br>
      <br>
      where "\n" causes a line break.
   </li>
   <li>
      <b><code>Append on reply = &lt;string&gt;</code></b><br>
      Same as before, but gets added after the previous entry.
   </li>
   <li>
      <b><code>Prepend on edit = &lt;string&gt;</code></b>
   </li>
   <li>
      <b><code>Append on edit = &lt;string&gt;</code></b><br>
      Same as before, but for editing entries.
   </li>
   <li>
      <b><code>Sort Attributes = &lt;list&gt;</code></b><br>
      For the list display, the entries are normally sorted by their ID.
      Alternatively, one can specify one or more (separated by commata)
      attributes, which are used for sorting. The first attribute in the list
      has the highest priority. Only if two entries have the same value in
      the first sort attribute, they are sorted according to the second sort
      attribute and so on. To the list of attributes one can add <b>ID</b>,
      <b>Date</b> and <b>logbook</b>, although <b>ID</b> makes only sense
      together with other attributes, since it is sorted as the primary
      key anyhow.

   Conditional attributes
</div>
<p>
   When entering data into a elog form, it might be helpful to change the
   options of the attributes depending on the value of other attributes.
   Let's assume you have a logbook containing entries for different
   computers with different operating systems. Your elogd.cfg file starts
   like that:
</p>
<ul>
   <li>
        <pre>
Attributes = PC Name, Operating System, Version
Options Operating System = Linux, Windows
</pre>
   </li>
</ul>
<p>
   For the operating system version, you would like a list, but this list
   has to be different for Linux and Windows. This can be achieved with
   <i>conditional attributes</i>. Simply write following configuration:
</p>
<ul>
   <li>
        <pre>
Attributes = PC Name, Operating System, Version
Options Operating System = Linux{1}, Windows{2}
{1} Options Version = 2.2, 2.4, 2.6
{2} Options Version = ME, 2k, NT, XP
</pre>
   </li>
</ul>
<p>
   If you enter a new entry into that logbook, the drop-down list for
   <code><b>Version</b></code> changes automatically depending on the
   <code><b>Operating System</b></code>. Note that you have to enable Java
   Script for this to work. Without Java Script, a separate button appears
   in the line of the Operating System which has to be pressed to make the
   Version list change.
</p>
<p>
   The number {1} and {2} in the configuration file are called
   <i>conditions</i>. Depending on these conditions, certain other lines can
   be activated. So if the Operating System <i>Linux</i> is selected,
   condition {1} is true, which selects the line starting with {1} to select
   the options <i>2.2, 2.4, 2.6</i>.
</p>
<p>
   This technique offers various other possibilities, since any
   configuration option can be made conditional by adding a
   <code><b>{&lt;n&gt;}</b></code> in front of that line where &lt;n&gt; is
   an arbitrary number. One often used possibility is the definition of
   forms. Depending on an attribute, the configuration option
   <code><b>Preset text = ...</b></code> can be used to copy some
   pre-defined forms into the message body, which can then be filled out.
   Consider following example:
</p>
<ul>
   <li>
        <pre>
Attributes = Author, Type
Options Type = Network check{1}, System check{2}

{1} Preset text = network.txt
{2} Preset text = system.txt
</pre>
   </li>
</ul>
<p>
   This causes two text files <i>network.txt</i> and <i>system.txt</i> to be
   copied into the message body when a new entry is made. The file
   <i>network.txt</i> could look like:
</p>
<ul>
   <li>
        <pre>
Routers checked:  [ ]
DHCP checked:     [ ]
Comment: ...
</pre>
   </li>
</ul>
<p>
   This works like a pre-defined form, the user puts X's between the "[ ]"
   when that item has been checked. Other possibilities are pre-defined
   shift sheets in environments where elog is uses as a shift logbook. The
   shift sheet could contain the names of the shift crew, some check-list
   for standard tasks etc.
</p>
<p>
   Another use of conditional attributes is in conjunction with the option
   <code><b>Message comment</b></code>. Depending on some attribute values,
   different message comments can be displayed to tell the user what to enter
   exactly in the message body for that attribute value.
</p>
<p>
   <b><code>Show Attributes Edit = &lt;list&gt;</code></b><br>
   When using conditional attributes, it might be necessary to omit certain
   attributes under certain conditions, to make the input mask shorter and
   maybe change the order of the attributes. With this option, a subset of
   all attributes can be specified which get displayed on the single entry
   page in the same order as they are specified here. This option mainly
   makes sense when used with conditions, such as:
</p>
<ul>
   <li>
        <pre>
Attributes = PC Name, Operating System, Version, Distribution
Options Operating System = Linux{1}, Windows{2}
{1} Show Attributes Edit = Operating System, Distribution, PC Name
{2} Show Attributes Edit = Operating System, PC Name, Version
</pre>
   </li>
</ul>
<p>
   The above statements cause the atrribute <b><code>Version</code></b> to be
   only visible when "Windows" is selected, and
   <b><code>Distribution</code></b> to be only visible when "Linux" is
   selected. If "Windows" is selected, the PC name is shown before the
   version.
</p>
<h2>
   Multiple conditions
</h2>

<p>
   It is possible to define conditions in more than one options list. The
   only requiremnt is that conditions are uniquie, meaning that a condition in
   one option list cannot be used in another list. This can easily be avoided
   by using numbers for one condition and letters for the other condition,
   like in the following example:
</p>
<ul>
   <li>
        <pre>
Attributes = PC Name, Operating System, Version, Location, Floor
Options Operating System = Linux{1}, Windows{2}
Options Location = Main Building{a}, New Building{b}, Old Building{c}
{1} Options Version = 2.2, 2.4, 2.6
{2} Options Version = ME, 2k, NT, XP
{a} Options Floor = Ground, First, Second
{b,c} Options Floor = Ground, First
</pre>
   </li>
</ul>
<p>
   It is possible to specify an OR of several conditions like in the case
   {b,c}. This is also possible over several conditions, like {1,a} would
   mean <i>"The PC has Linux or is in the Main Building"</i>. To specify a
   AND between conditions, a "&amp;" is used. The condition
</p>
<ul>
   <li>
        <pre>
{1&amp;a} ...
</pre>
   </li>
</ul>
<p>
   specifies for example the condition "Linux AND Main Building". If
   several lines with condition combinations are true, the upper one is used.
</p>

<h2>
   Conditions in the list display
</h2>

<p>
   Conditional attributes are usually only used for change items
   in the entry form. It might however be desirable to have conditional
   attibutes also working in the list display (the page where several
   entries are shown on a single page). The value of one attribute can then
   for example change which other attributes gets displayed via the <B><code>
   list display</code></b> option. To enable the evaluation of conditional
   attributes for the list display, on uses the option
</p>

<ul>
   <li>
      <code><b>List conditions = 1</b></code><br>
   </li>
</ul>

<p>
   It should be noted that this option can cause a significant performance
   degradation if many conditional attributes are defines, so it should only
   be turned on when it is really needed.

   </li>
</ul>
<p>
   The passwords are encoded. New users can either be created by hitting
   <b>Register as new user</b> on the login page if <b><code>Self register =
   1</code></b> in the configuration file, or by the admin user in the
   <b>Config</b> page by pressing <b>New user</b>. The password file resides
   in the same directory as the logbooks. When a user is logged it,
   the entry for this user can be modified via the <b>Config</b> command.
</p>
<p>
   To start a new password file, follow these steps:
</p>
<ul>
   <li>Specify a password file name with <code><b>Password file =
      &lt;file&gt;</b></code> in the configuration file
   </li>
   <li>Connect to the logbook. You will be presented with the new user page.
      Enter the user login name, full name, email and password, then click
      on the "Save" button.
   </li>
   <li>Add <b><code>Admin user = &lt;user&gt;</code></b> into the
      configuration file, using your login name from above
   </li>
   <li>If you now enter the "Config" page, you can add other users
   </li>
   <li>Remove the self registration option if you like
   </li>
</ul>
<p>
   The presence of a password file requires all users to "<i>log in</i>"
   using their name and password, except when a guest login is allowed via
   the <b>"Guest menu commands"</b> option. An additional advantage of this
   method is that the user name can be used as an attribute value for
   creating logbook entries. For example, the following line could be added
   to the configuration file to fill in the <i>Author</i> and the
   <i>Email</i> attributes with the current user name and email:
</p>
<ul>
   <li>
      <code>Attributes = Author, Email, ...</code>
   </li>
</ul>
<ul>
   <li>
      <code>Subst Author = $long_name from $remote_host<br>
         Subst Email = $user_email</code>
   </li>
</ul>
<p>
   Thus the author name is not user-input anymore, ensuring the entry always
   contains the actual user name. For a full listing of substitutions, see
   the "<i>Subst &lt;attrib&gt;</i>" option.
</p>
<p>
   The user name and password are stored as cookies on the user side. The
   expiration is controlled by the <b><code>Remember me</code></b> checkbox
   during the login. If unchecked, the cookies expire after the current
   browser session. If checked, they expire after 31 days by default, which
   can be changed with the <code><b>Login expiration</b></code> option,
   giving the expiration time in hours. Setting this to 24 for example,
   makes the password expire after one day. If presistent cookies are not
   desired, the <code><b>Login expiration</b></code> option can be set to
   zero, in which case the <b><code>Remember me</code></b> checkbox is not
   displayed.
</p>
<p>
   The <code><b>Admin user = &lt;user list&gt;</b></code> is a list of one
   or more user names, which have admin rights. They see a button
   <b><code>Change elogd.cfg</code></b> on the config page by which they can
   edit elogd.cfg through the web. They can also modify other users on the
   <b><code>Config</code></b> page, change their passwords or remove them.
   In addition, the admin user(s) can delete or edit entries from other
   users if <code><b>Restrict edit = 1</b></code>.
</p>
<p>
   The <code><b>Login user = &lt;user list&gt;</b></code> is a list of users
   who can log in to a specific logbook. This option can be used with a
   global password file. If a <b><code>Password file</code></b> is present
   under the <code><b>[global]</b></code> section, the registered users in
   that password file can log in to all logbooks. It might be required that
   only certain users can log in to certain logbooks. This can be achieved
   with the <b><code>Login user</code></b> option, places in each individual
   logbook section in the configuration file. Only those users listed in
   this statement can log in to the logbook where the statement is defined.
   This method has the advantage over the option of definining individual
   password files for individual logbooks that only one central password
   file exists. So if a user changes her/his password, this becomes then
   valid for all logbooks. If there would be individual logbook password
   files, one would have to change the password in all logbooks
   individually.
</p>
<ul>
   <li>
      <b><code>Self register = 0|1|2|3|4</code></b>
   </li>
</ul>
<p>
   With this option it is possible for new users to self-register an user
   account. At the login page, a link is displayed <b>"Register as a new
   user"</b> which leads the user to a configuration page where one can
   enter the account name, full name and email address. A flag allows for
   automatic email notification on new entries on the logbook. These
   settings can later be changed with the <b>Config</b> menu command.
</p>
<p>
   Setting this option to <b>0</b> disables self registration. With option
   <b>1</b>, users can silently register, while setting it to <b>2</b>
   causes elogd to send an email notification to the admin user(s). The
   option <b>3</b> is used to <i>only</i> send an email notification to the
   admin users(s), which then can validate the account and commit it by
   hitting the URL given in the email notification. Setting this to <b>4</b>
   causes and email notification to be sent to the user, which then can
   validate the account herself/himself proving to have a working
   email account.
</p>
<ul>
   <li>
      <b><code>Allow password change = 0|1</code></b>
   </li>
</ul>
<p>
   Enables or disabled the ability for users to change their password. If
   disabled, the <i>"Forgot password?</i> link in the login page is ommitted
   as well. The admin user(s) can always change passwords.
</p>
<ul>
   <li>
      <b><code>Allow &lt;command&gt; = &lt;user list&gt;</code></b>
   </li>
</ul>
<p>
   Commands can be restricted to certain login names (separated by commas).
   For each command in the list defined with the "<i>Menu commands</i>"
   option, a list of user names can be specified, which are allowed to
   execute that command. If the allow option is not present, all users may
   execute that command by default.
</p>
<ul>
   <li>
      <b><code>Deny &lt;command&gt; = &lt;user list&gt;</code></b>
   </li>
</ul>
<p>
   Used to deny a certain command to a list of users. This can be used to
   deny a guest user to enter new messages or modify a message.
</p>
<ul>
   <li>
      <b><code>Hosts allow = &lt;list&gt;</code></b>
   </li>
   <li>
      <b><code>Hosts deny = &lt;list&gt;</code></b>
   </li>
</ul>
<p>
   These two settings can be used to restrict the access to the logbook to
   certain computers. It is similar to the UNIX <i>hosts.allow</i> and
   <i>hosts.deny</i> files. The list can consist of individual host names or
   IP numbers, subnet masks like <code><b>123.213.</b></code> (note the
   trailing '.') or <code><b>.mit.edu</b></code>, or the word
   <b><code>All</code></b>. The following rules are applied:
</p>
<ul>
   <li>Access will be granted when a host matches a pattern in "<i>hosts
      allow</i>".
   </li>
   <li>Otherwise, access will be denied when a host matches a pattern in
      "<i>hosts deny</i>".
   </li>
   <li>Otherwise, access will be granted.
   </li>
</ul>
<p>
   These rules are applied <i>before</i> any password is checked. To debug
   problems, start <code><b>elogd</b></code> with the "-v" flag, in which
   case the rule checking is printed on the screen.
</p>
<p>
   The global option <code><b>Logfile = &lt;filename&gt;</b></code> can be
   specified to log all user login/logout activities plus all successful
   user connections.
</p>
<p>
   If any of the password statements are in the <b><code>[global]</code></b>
   area of the configuration files, they are used for all logbooks. If one
   logs in at one logbook, access is automaticlly granted to all logbooks.
   If the password statements are in the individual logbook sections, one
   has to log in to each logbook separately.
</p>

<h2>
   Kerberos authentication
</h2>
<p>
   Starting from version 2.9.0, site authentication has been implemented
   in elog using the <a href="http://web.mit.edu/kerberos/">Kerberos</a>
   authentication scheme. This widely used system is also used in MS Windows
   Domain Controllers, and can be used for site logins, meaning that the
   same credentials can be used on all computers of a site.
</p>
<p>
   To use that authetication, Kerberos has to be installed on the server
   running the elogd daemon. Please read the Kerberos documentation how to
   do this or talk to your site administrator. There are packages for Linux,
   Windows and Mac OSX. If you compile the elogd program yourself, make sure
   to have the flag <code><B>HAVE_KRB5</B></code>> defined in the compilation process.
   To configure elogd to use Kerberos, use following options:
</p>
<ul>
   <li>
      <b><code>Authentication = &lt;method(s)&gt;</code></b>
   </li>
   <li>
      <b><code>Kerberos Realm = &lt;realm&gt;</code></b>
   </li>
</ul>

<p>
   where &lt;method(s)&gt; can be <code><b>File</b></code> or
   <code><b>Kerberos</b></code> or both such
   as in <code><b>Kerberos, File</b></code>. If the authentication option contains
   <b>Kerberos</b>, the user credentials are authenticated using the default
   Kerberos Realm. This is typically obtained from the file
   <b><code>c:\windows\krb5.ini</code></b> (Windows) or
   <b><code>/etc/krb5.conf</code></b> (Linux). If another than the default
   realm should be used, this can be overwritten with the <b><code>Kerberos
   Realm</code></b> option.
</p>
<p>
   When Kerberos authentication is used, the password file is still used
   to store additional user information such as the full name and the email
   address, but the authentication is done via the Kerberos server.
</p>
<p>
   If both authentications <code><b>Kerberos, File</b></code> are enabled,
   the credentials are first authenticated via the Kerberos server, and - if
   not successful - via the password file. This allows combined elog
   installations with centralized and local elog accounts. If the Kerberos
   authentication was successful, the password in the password
   file is overwritten with the encrypted Kerberos password. This allows the
   system to work even if the Kerberos server is temporarily not accessible.
</p>
<p>
   If the password is changed via the "Change Password" button on the config
   page, the system tries to change the password in the Kerberos database. On
   some installation it has been found that this does not work, in which case
   you have to change your password by other means (such as via the Windows
   login if you use a Windows Domain).
</p>
<p>
   Beside the Kerberos authentication, elogd version 3.0 and higher can be configured to accept a authentication done
   by the webserver.
<ul>
   <li>
      <b><code>Authentication = Webserver</code></b>
   </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
   You can also combine it with other authentication methods as shown for Kerberos.
</p>
<p>
   Elogd is then accepting the username set in the Request-Header "X-Forwarded-User" as already logged in.<br/>
   To make this work, you need to configure the webserver correctly, as describe in the adminguide.
</p>


<h2>
   LDAP authentication
</h2>
<p>
   LDAP (lightweight Directory Access Protocol) has been implemented by
   vykozlov in a separate branch at <a href="https://github.com/vykozlov/elog-ldap">https://github.com/vykozlov/elog-ldap</a>. The code has been merged into this distribution on
   an as-is basis. Following info has copied from the link above:</p>

<p>
   To use LDAP authentication, do the following:
</p>

<ul>
   <li>
      Enable LDAP authentication in the <b><code>Makefile</code></b> by setting
      <b><code>USE_LDAP = 1</code></b>
   </li>
   <li>
      Change elogd.cf to contain LDAP authentication:
      <ul>
         <li><b><code>Authentication = LDAP</code></b></li>
         <li><b><code>LDAP server = ldap://example.org:389</code></b></li>
         <li><b><code>LDAP userbase = ou=People;dc=example,dc=org</code></b></li>
         <li><b><code>LDAP login attribute = uid</code></b></li>
         <li><b><code>LDAP register = 1</code></b></li>
      </ul>
      The <code><b>login attribute</b></code> is from the DN (distinguished name), e.g.
      uid=user,ou=People,dc=example,dc=org. The <code><b>register</b></code> flag determines
      if LDAP users are automatically stored in the local password file, which is
      necessary for email notifications.
   </li>
</ul>

<p>
   Please note that it is not possible to change a password in the LDAP database from within ELOG.
</p>

<h2>
   PAM authentication
</h2>
<p>
PAM (Pluggable authentication modules) support has been implemented by Jan Christoph Terasa as a separate branch at <a href="https://bitbucket.org/ritt/elog/branch/pam">https://bitbucket.org/ritt/elog/branch/pam</a>.

<p>
   To use PAM in elogd, do the following:
</p>

<ul>
   <li>
      Compile <b><code>elogd</code></b> with PAM support, by either setting <b><code>USE_PAM = 1</code></b> in the <b><code>Makefile</code></b>, or by specifying it when invoking <b><code>make</code></b>
   </li>
   <li>
      Enable PAM authentication in <b><code>elogd.cfg</code></b>:
      <ul>
         <li><b><code>Authentication = PAM</code></b></li>
         <li><b><code>Password file = elogd.passwd</code></b></li>
         <li><b><code>Self register = 3</code></b></li>
      </ul>
      The <b><code>Password file</code></b> is used to store the user names and email addresses of PAM authenticated users, since this information can not be (universally) requested via PAM. For security reasons the password file does <b>not</b> store a hash of the user password.
      Self registration has to be enabled (<b><code>Self register &ge; 1</code></b>) to use PAM authentication.
   </li>
   <li>
      To be able to use PAM, the PAM module in <b><code>elogd</code></b> needs to be able to access the authentication facilities on the system (e.g. be able to read <code>/etc/shadow</code>). This can be achieved by either running <b><code>elogd</code></b> as <code>root</code>, or by specifying the appropriate SUID/GUID values for the binary.</br>
      <font color="red"><b>WARNING:</font> When running elogd as root, be careful when using the <code>-x</code> option to enable execution of commands via <code>$shell</code>, since the commands will be executed using the access rights of the user running <code>elogd</code>!</b>
</ul>

<p>
   Please note that it is not possible to change the PAM password within ELOG. Instead, please use the available methods on the system
</p>

<div class="section">
   EMail notification
</div>
<ul>
   <li>
      <b><code>Email &lt;attribute&gt; &lt;value&gt; =
         &lt;list&gt;</code></b>
   </li>
   <li>
      <b><code>Use Email Subject = &lt;string&gt;</code></b>
   </li>
   <li>
      <b><code>Use Email Subject Edit = &lt;string&gt;</code></b>
   </li>
   <li>
      <b><code>Use Email From = &lt;string&gt;</code></b>
   </li>
   <li>
      <b><code>Default Email From = &lt;string&gt;</code></b>
   </li>
   <li>
      <b><code>Use Email Heading = &lt;string&gt;</code></b>
   </li>
   <li>
      <b><code>Use Email Heading Edit = &lt;string&gt;</code></b>
   </li>
   <li>
      <b><code>Omit Email To = 0|1</code></b>
   </li>
   <li>
      <b><code>Suppress Email to users = 0|1</code></b>
   </li>
   <li>
      <b><code>Email attributes = &lt;list&gt;</code></b>
   </li>
   <li>
      <b><code>Use Email URL = &lt;URL&gt;</code></b>
   </li>
</ul>
<p>
   To send email automatically when new entries are created in a logbook, a
   <code><b>SMTP host =</b></code> entry must be present in the
   <b><code>[global]</code></b> section of the configuration file. To submit
   an email based on an attribute value, use the statement <code><b>Email
   &lt;attribute&gt; &lt;value&gt; = &lt;list&gt;</b></code>. Whenever an
   entry is submitted where <b><code>attribute</code></b> is equal to
   <b><code>value</code></b>, an email notification is sent to the email
   addresses in <b><code>list</code></b>. Several mail addresses may be
   supplied, separated by commas. The mail addresses can contain attributes
   via the <b>"$"</b> substitution. If a logbook contains for example an
   attribute <i>name</i> which contains email names, then one can put
   <i>$name@domain</i> to form a valid email address.
</p>
<p>
   Multiple <b><code>Email xxx</code></b> statements may occur in a
   configuration file. If either the attribute or the value contains one or
   more blanks the string must be enclosed with quotation marks, as in:
</p>
<ul>
   <li>
      <code>Email type "Normal routine" = ...</code>
   </li>
</ul>
<p>
   The statement <b><code>Email All = &lt;list&gt;</code></b> sends an email
   notification independent of the type and category. The <code><b>Use Email
   Subject = &lt;string&gt;</b></code> statement specifies which text is
   used as the email subject. The text can contain
   <b><code>$&lt;attribute&gt;</code></b> statements which are substituted
   with the current value of that attribute. For a full list of possible
   substitutions, see the "<i>Subst &lt;attribute&gt;</i>" option. The
   <b><code>Use Email Heading = &lt;string&gt;</code></b> specifies the text
   for the email heading line. Default is <i>"A new entry has been submitted
   on [host]"</i>. The option <b><code>Use Email Heading Edit =
   &lt;string&gt;</code></b> works the same way for updated (edited)
   entries.
</p>
<p>
   The option <b><code>Use Email From = &lt;string&gt;</code></b> is used
   for the "<i>From:</i>" field in the email. Since more and more email
   servers do not accept invalid <i>"From:"</i> addresses in order to reduce
   spam mail, it might be important that a "real" email address is used in
   the <i>"From:"</i> field. If  <b><code>Use Email From</code></b> is
   present, it is always used. If not, the email address of the currently
   logged in user is used for the <i>"From:"</i> field. If no user is logged
   in, or the current user has not specified a email address in the password
   database, the setting of the option <b><code>Default Email From</code></b>
   is used for the "<i>From:</i>" field. Only if this option is not specified,
   a generic address <i>ELOG@&lt;hostname&gt;</i> is used, which might be
   rejected by the SMTP server however.
</p>
<p>
   If the flag <code><b>Omit Email To</b></code> is set to <b>1</b>, the
   <i>To:</i> field in the email is left empty instead set to the real email
   address of the recipients. This can be useful if one recipient should not
   see the email addresses of the other recipients.
</p>
<p>
   The flag <code><b>Suppress Email to users</b></code> can be set to
   <b>"1"</b> if email should only be sent to the recipients of the
   <b><code>Email &lt;attribute&gt; &lt;value&gt; = &lt;list&gt;</code></b>
   statements but not to the users who have registerd for automatic email
   notification.
</p>
<p>
   If one wants to send only some attributes but not all in an email
   notification, one can use the option <b><code>Email attributes =
   &lt;list&gt;</code></b>, where a subset of the attributes can be
   specified as well as their order. <a name="flags" id="flags"></a>
</p>

<p>
   The option <b><code>Use Email URL = &lt;URL&gt;</b></code> can be used to
   set the URL of the ELOG logbook used in email notifications. This can be
   useful if no <b><code>URL = ...</code></b> statement is used form some
   reason.
</p>

<div class="section">
   Flags
</div>
<ul>
   <li>
      <b><code>Show text = 0|1</code></b><br>
      This flag controls if logbook entries contain a body text. If an
      installation only requires attributes, this flag can be set to
      <b>0</b>. Default is <b>1</b>.
   </li>
   <li>
      <b><code>Enable attachments = 0|1</code></b><br>
      This flag controls the attachment submission at the bottom of a message
      entry page. If this flag is <b>0</b>, the attachment section is not
      displayed. This might be useful for logbooks where attachments are not
      used. Default is <b>1</b>.
   </li>
   <li>
      <b><code>Show attachments = 0|1</code></b><br>
      This flag controls the display of attachments such as images on normal
      logbook pages. For logbooks with large images, this flag can be turned
      off, so that attachments are only displayed when they are clicked on.
      Default is <b>1</b>.
   </li>
   <li>
      <b><code>Preview attachments = 0|1</code></b><br>
      This flag controls the display of attachments in the edit form. If one
      one uploads an attachment, but has not yet submitted the entry,
      the uploaded attachments are shown at the bottom if this flag is <b>1</b>.
      Only ASCII files and images are shown of course. Default is <b>1</b>.
   </li>
   <li>
      <b><code>Summary lines = x</code></b><br>
      This specifies the number of text lines displayed in a summary page.
      Zero displays no text at all. The default is 3.
   </li>
   <li>
      <b><code>Summary line length = x</code></b><br>
      This specifies the number of charactes of the summary lines. After this
      number of charactes, a line break is inserted in long lines to keep the
      column width not too wide. The default is 40.
   </li>
   <li>
      <b><code>Attachment lines = x</code></b><br>
      This specifies the number of text lines displayed for ASCII attachments.
      For long ASCII attachments, it can be useful to only display the first
      few lines not to make the HTML page too long. The default is <b>300</b>.
   </li>
   <li>
      <b><code>Reverse sort = 0|1</code></b><br>
      If this flag is <b>1</b>, all listing pages (the default page view, the
      result of a search query and the result of the <i>"Last day"</i> query)
      is sorted in reverse order (newest entry down to oldest). The checkbox
      <i>Sort in reverse order</i> on the search form gets checked by
      default, too. Sorting in reverse order can make sense if there are many
      pages of entries, but the ones entered last should be displayed on the
      first page. Default is <b>0</b>.
   </li>
   <li>
      <b><code>Search all logbooks = 0|1|2</code></b><br>
      If this flag is <b>1</b> or <b>2</b>, the search form displays the button
      <i>"Search all logbooks"</i>. If the flag is <b>2</b>, the button
      is checked by default. Setting this flag to <b>0</b> hides this button.
      It might be necessary to do this for public logbooks if
      there are also protected logbooks. Otherwise the search result would
      also display entries from the protected logbooks. The default is <b>1</b>.
   </li>
   <li>
      <b><code>Enable browsing = 0|1</code></b><br>
      If this flag is <b>1</b>, browsing (hitting the next/previous button)
      is enabled. For some rare occasions it might be necessary to disable
      browsing. Default is <b>1</b>.
   </li>
   <li>
      <b><code>Filtered browsing = 0|1</code></b><br>
      If this flag is <b>1</b>, browsing (hitting the next/previous button)
      can be filtered by individual attributes. If the checkbox next to an
      attribute is checked, only messages with the same attribute value are
      displayed. Default is <b>0</b>.
   </li>
   <li>
      <b><code>Default encoding = 0|1|2</code></b><br>
      This specifies the default encoding for new entries. For installations
      where entries are normally submitted as plain text, the default can be
      set to <b>1</b>. Set to <b>0</b> for <a href=
                                                      "http://elog.psi.ch/elog/elcode_en.html">ELCode</a> encoding, to
      <b>2</b> for HTML encoding. The default is <b>2</b>, which activates
      the built in FCKeditor automatically for new installations. If this
      editor is not wanted or people are concerned about cross site scripting,
      the default encoding should be set to <b>0</b> or <b>1</b>.
   </li>
   <li>
      <b><code>Allowed encoding = &lt;n&gt;</code></b><br>
      Allowed encoding options. <b><code>&lt;n&gt;</b></code> can be the sum of
      following flags:
      <ul>
         <li>1 : Plain
         </li>
         <li>2 : ELCode encoding
         </li>
         <li>4 : HTML encoding
         </li>
      </ul>
      To allow plain and HTML encoding for example, set
      <b><code>&lt;n&gt;</b></code> to 5. Default is <b>7</b>. Note that
      allowing HTML encoding may cause some security risk, since an elog
      entry may contain malicious scripting code. It should therefor only
      be allowed for installations where it is really needed and with no
      public write access.
   </li>
   <li>
      <b><code>Allow HTML = 0|1</code></b><br>
      This flag allows or denys the usage of HTML in attributes. Note that
      allowing HTML encoding may cause some security risk, since an elog
      entry may contain malicious scripting code. It should therefor only
      be allowed for installations where it is really needed and with no
      public write access. The default value is <b>0</b>.
   </li>
   <li>
      <b><code>Suppress default = 0|1|2|3</code></b><br>
      This specifies the default state of the "<i>Suppress Email
      notification</i>" button on the new message entry form. For
      installations where normally an email notification is not necessary,
      the default can be set to <b>1</b>. If an important entry is entered,
      users can then uncheck the suppress box. If this value is set to
      <b>2</b> , the suppress box is not displayed at all, so that an email
      notification is always produced. If this value is set to <b>3</b>, the
      email notification is always suppressed. The default is <b>0</b>.
   </li>
   <li>
      <b><code>Suppress Email on edit = 0|1|2|3</code></b><br>
      This is the same as <b><code>Suppress default</code></b>, but just for
      edited entries. The default is <b>0</b>.
   </li>
   <li>
      <b><code>Resubmit default = 0|1|2</code></b><br>
      This specifies the default state of the "<i>Resubmit as new entry</i>"
      button on the edit message entry from. If this button is checked, the
      current message is removed from its current position in the database
      and submitted as a new message. This can for example be useful for
      applications where users want to see which records have been updated
      recently. If this value is set to <b>2</b>, the resubmit box is not
      displayed at all. The default is <b>0</b>.
   </li>
   <li>
      <b><code>Resubmit replies = 0|1</code></b><br>
      If this flag is set to <b>1</b> and an entry is resubmited as a new
      entry and this entry has replies, all replies of this entry are
      resubmittes as new entries as well. The default is <b>0</b>.
   </li>
   <li>
      <b><code>Display Email recipients = 0|1</code></b><br>
      If this flag is <b>1</b>, the email recipients are displayed when a
      logbook entry is entered which produces an email notification. Setting
      this flag to 0 suppresses this display, in case users need not see that
      email is being sent and to whom. The default is <b>1</b>.
   </li>
   <li>
      <b><code>Email Format = &lt;n&gt;</code></b><br>
      Specifies what is sent in an email notification. &lt;n&gt; is the sum
      of following flags:<br>
      <ul>
         <li>1 : Send heading line "A new entry has been submitted..."
         </li>
         <li>2 : Send attributes
         </li>
         <li>4 : Send URL of logbook entry
         </li>
         <li>8 : Send message body
         </li>
         <li>16: Send optional attachments as email attachments
         </li>
         <li>32: Send logbook name
         </li>
         <li>64: Send names of optional attachments
         </li>
      </ul>So to send for example only the attributes and the URL, set
      &lt;n&gt; to <b>6</b>. Default is <b>63</b> (send everything).
   </li>
   <li>
      <b><code>Email Encoding = &lt;n&gt;</code></b><br>
      Specifies in which encoding an email is sent. &lt;n&gt; is the sum of
      following flags:<br>
      <ul>
         <li>1 : Plain text
         </li>
         <li>2 : HTML in the form of the plain text, but with ELCode
            interpreted
         </li>
         <li>4 : Full HTML page as shown in elog
         </li>
      </ul>So to send email in plain text and full HTML, set &lt;n&gt; to
      <b>5</b>. Some email clients have the possibility then to switch from
      one view to the other. Default is <b>2</b>.
   </li>
   <li>
      <b><code>Max email attachment size = &lt;n&gt;</code></b><br>
      This option specifies the maximum allowed email attachment size for
      email notifications. Most mail delivery systems have a maximum attachment
      size and refuse to accept emails with larger sizes. If the size of an
      attachment exceeds this limit, it is not included in the email notificaiton
      but rather a link to the attachment on the elog server is used.
      The default value is <b>10000000</b> (ten million bytes).
   </li>
   <li>
      <b><code>Back to main = 0|1</code></b><br>
      If this flag is <b>1</b>, the "<i>List</i>" button takes you back to
      the logbook selection page instead to the last entry of the current
      logbook. The default is <b>0</b>.
   </li>
   <li>
      <b><code>Logout to main = 0|1</code></b><br>
      If this flag is <b>1</b>, the "<i>Logout</i>" operation takes you back
      to the logbook selection page instead to the login page. The default is
      <b>0</b>.
   </li>
   <li>
      <b><code>Logout to URL = &lt;URL&gt;</code></b><br>
      If this URL is set, the "<i>Logout</i>" operation takes you to
      a specific web page specified in the URL.
   </li>
   <li>
      <b><code>List after submit = 0|1</code></b><br>
      If this flag is <b>1</b>, the list page is shown after the
      submission of a new entry. If this flag is <b>0</b>, the entry just
      submitted is shown. The default is <b>0</b>.
   </li>
   <li>
      <b><code>Restrict edit = 0|1</code></b><br>
      If this flag is <b>1</b>, users can only edit their own messages. The
      system checks automatically if the currently logged in user matches the
      user supplied in an author attribute via the <i>"Preset xxxx"</i>
      option. The default is <b>0</b>.
   </li>
   <li>
      <b><code>Expand default = 0|1|2|3</code></b><br>
      This setting determines how messages are displayed in threaded mode.
      Following options are possible:
      <ul>
         <li>
            <b>0</b>: Only message heads are displayed, no replies. A "+"
            indicates which message has one or more replies.
         </li>
         <li>
            <b>1</b>: Messages and replies are displayed, but no message body.
         </li>
         <li>
            <b>2</b>: Messages and replies are displayed together with the
            first few lines of the message body. The number of lines is
            controlled by the <code><b>Summary lines</b></code> option.
         </li>
         <li>
            <b>3</b>: Messages and replies are displayed together with the full
            message body.
         </li>
      </ul>The default is <b>1</b>.
   </li>
   <li>
      <b><code>Hidden = 0|1</code></b><br>
      If this flag is <b>1</b>, the logbook is not displayed in the initial
      logbook selection page and in the logbook tabs. This can be useful for
      logbooks which are only accessed for backup or archiving and would
      clutter up the logbook list for the normal user. To access hidden
      logbooks, one has to enter the logbook URL directly, or from a bookmark
      list. Default is <b>0</b>.
   </li>
   <li>
      <b><code>Hide Comments = 0|1</code></b><br>
      If this flag is <b>1</b>, the logbook "Comment" is not displayed in the
      logbook selection page. Default is <b>0</b>.
   </li>
   <li>
      <b><code>Use Lock = 0|1</code></b><br>
      If this flag is <b>1</b>, a logbook entry is <i>locked</i> when someone
      edits it (clicking the <i>Edit</i> command). A locked message gets
      displayed with a little red sign indicating that the message is
      currently edited by someone and should not be touched. This can be
      helpful in installations where several people can edit messages.
      Without locking, the second submission of an edited message overwrites
      the first submission without notice. Although the sign gets displayed,
      the message can still be edited (the lock can be "stolen"), but it's
      the user's response to avoid any conflict.<br>
      <br>
      Since elog cannot determine if someone keeps a message very long for
      editing or if only the browser got closed, the locking can show up even
      if the message is not kept for editing any more. In that case, the
      message has to be edited again and submitted, to remove the origial
      lock.<br>
      <br>
      Note that logbooks accessible from the internet usually get scanned by
      search engines. This can lead to situations where the <i>Edit</i> link
      of each message is "followed" by a bot, resulting in all messages being
      locked. In those cases locking has to be turned off.<br>
      <br>
      Since release 2.5.4, some Javascript code has been added to avoid
      unwanted locks. If someone edits an entry, but then goes away from that
      page or closes the browser without submitting the changes, a pop-up
      window appears asking the user to submit the changed entry. Although
      this works for most browsers in most cases, it could be that Javascript
      has been turned off in a browser, in which case the stale locks still
      might appear.<br>
      <br>
      Default for "Use Lock" is <b>0</b>.
   </li>
   <li>
      <b><code>Show top groups = 0|1</code></b><br>
      When using top groups, the root of the elogd server is not accessible
      any more, to avoid cases where one group can "see" the logbooks of the
      other groups. If this feature is unwanted, the flag <code><b>Show top
      groups</b></code> can be set to <code><b>1</b></code>, in which case a
      list of available top groups is shown.
   </li>
   <li>
      <b><code>Fix text = 0|1</code></b><br>
      With this options the main text body can be fixed, so that it cannot be
      changed via the <b><code>Edit</code></b> button later. This feature can
      be useful for set-ups where some attributed must be changed later, but
      the text body should be preserved. The default is <b>0</b>.
   </li>
   <li>
      <b><code>Case sensitive search = 0|1</code></b><br>
      This switch has two meanings. First, it defines the default state of
      the <code><b>Case sensitive</b></code> check box in the "Find" page.
      Second, it determines if the quick filters are case sensitive or not.
      The default is <b>0</b>.
   </li>
   <li>
      <b><code>Mode commands = 0|1</code></b><br>
      If this flag is missing or set to <b>1</b>, the links "Full", "Summary"
      and "Threaded" are shown on the top of the listing page. If this flag
      is set to <b>0</b>, these commands are hidden. This might be useful in
      logbooks where only one mode makes sense for example.
   </li>
   <li>
      <b><code>Suppress execute default = 0|1</code></b><br>
      External scripts can be called with the <code><b>Execute
      new/edit/delete</b></code> options. If these options are enabled, a
      checkbox appears which lets the user suppress execution of the external
      script. The setting of this flag determines the default state of this
      checkbox. In logbooks where a script should only be ocasionally
      executed, it could make sense to set this flag to <b>1</b>.
   </li>
   <li>
      <b><code>Preserve IDs = 0|1</code></b><br>
      When a logbook entry is copied or moved to another logbook, it obtains
      a new entry ID in the destination logbook. This can cause problems
      if the logbook entries reference each other with their IDs. To keep the
      same ID in the destination logbook, this setting can be set to <b>1</b>.
      If an entry with the same ID in the destination logbook exists already,
      it gets overwritten. Default for this setting is <b>0</b>.
   </li>
   <li>
      <b><code>Collapse to last = 0|1</code></b><br>
      In threaded view, the list of replies can be collapsed into a single
      entry. If this flag is 1, then the last entry of each thread is shown,
      otherwise the first thread is displayed. Default for this setting is <b>1</b>.
   </li>
   <li>
      <b><code>Sort Attribute Options &lt;attribute&gt; = 0|1</code></b><br>
      If this option is 1, the options for this attribute are sorted alphanumerically.
      This can be handy when locating options from long lists in drop-down boxes in
      quick filters for example. Default for this setting is <b>0</b>.
   </li>
   <li>
      <b><code>Allow branching = 0|1</code></b><br>
      With this option one can probihit "branching", which is that an entry gets
      more than one reply. When branching is prohibited, only linear threads are
      possible, which is one head entry, one reply to it, then one reply to the reply
      and so on. Default for this setting is <b>1</b>.
   </li>
   <li>
      <b><code>Enable Smileys = 0|1</code></b><br>
      When encoding an entry with ELCode, certain sequenes such as <b>:-)</b> get
      automatically converted into small "smiley" images. If this behavior is not
      wanted, it can be turned off with this option. The default for this setting is <b>1</b>.
   </li>
   <li>
      <b><code>Refresh = &lt;seconds&gt;</code></b><br>
      The elog listing page can be refreshed periodically with this option. If it is
      given, the page automatically reloads after &lt;seconds&gt;. This can be useful
      for logbooks where other people often post entries or where some entries
      are posted automatically (via the elog utility) and one wants to keep an eye on
      what's new. The default for this setting is <b>0</b> meaning no refresh.
   </li>
   <li>
      <b><code>Show last default = &lt;days&gt;</code></b><br>
      In large logbooks, search operations can take quite long, blocking other users
      from accessing ELOG. On the <i>Find</i> page, one can restrict the search operation
      to a certain time period, like last day, last week, etc, which makes searching
      much faster, but restricts it to a certain time in the past. If one forgets
      however to enter anyting in the <i>Show last</i> drop-down box, then the
      search again can take quite long. This option pre-selects an option in the
      <i>Show last</i> drop-down box, so that the user does not have to think about
      selecting a certain time period. Following options are possible: <b>0, 1, 3,
      7, 31, 92, 182, 364</b>. "0" means an unrestricted search default.
   </li>
   <li>
      <b><code>Save drafts = 0|1</code></b><br>
      Starting with version 3.1, ELOG supports auto saving. When text for a new
      entry is entered in the browser, it might get lost if the browser windows is
      closed before the entry has been submitted. In order to avoid this, entries
      can be saved as drafts, to be finished and submitted later. This can be
      achieved by clicking on the <b><code>Save</code></b> button or by the
      <i>autosave</i> feature (see next option). The <b><code>Save drafts</code></b>
      option turns this feature on or off. Default is <b><code>1</code></b>.
   </li>
   <li>
      <b><code>Autosave = &lt;seconds&gt;</code></b><br>
      Drafts can be sent to the server regularly after some editing (see previous
      option). This option determines the interval this is done. The default is
      <b><code>10</code></b> seconds after the last edit. Setting Autosave to
      zero disables the autosave functionality.
   </li>
   <li>
      <b><code>List drafts = 0|1</code></b><br>
      By default, draft entries are shown in the list display in another browser
      when the entries are currently edited. This can be confusing to other users
      since the draft entries are frequently updated. To avoid this, this flag can
      be se to <b><code>0</code></b>, which hides all draft entries in the list view.
      If they are hidden, the only way to come back to them is to hit the
      <b><code>New</code></b> menu item, in which case the system presents to the user
      a list of open draft messages to be continued.

   Themes
</div>
<p>
   Themes are layout and color schemes which determine the look and feel of
   a logbook (sometimes called <i>"skins"</i>). A theme consists of a set of
   images, which are used for the title banner and browse buttons, and a
   Cascading Style Scheet (CSS), which defines the colors, fonts and spacing
   of the ELOG pages.
</p>
<p>
   Each theme resides in a separate subdirectory and is specified with the
   <b><code>theme = &lt;dir&gt;</code></b> option in the configuration file.
   Each theme can contain several CSSs, which can be selected with the
   <b><code>CSS = &lt;filename&gt;</code></b> option.
</p>
<p>
   A default theme is contained in the distribution. If new themes are
   developed by users, they can be sent back to the author, to be included
   in future releases.
</p>
<p>
   To change colors and fonts, the source of a ELOG page can be examined.
   All elements use CSS classes which are specified in the
   <b><code>class="&lt;name&gt;"</code></b> statements. These classes can be
   found in the <b><code>.../themes/default/default.css</code></b> file and
   changed accordingly. For a description of all options, please consult for
   example the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-CSS1">W3C</a> consortium.
</p>
<p>
   If the CSS file is edited, most browsers require a "reload" to refresh
   the modified file. The <b>elogd</b> daemon does not have to be restarted
   after a change in the CSS file.
</p>
<p>
   These two images display the same logbook entry using different themes:
</p>
<p>
   <img src="theme1.jpg"><img src="theme2.jpg">

   <a name="mirroring" id="mirroring"></a>

   Mirroring
</div>
<p>
   Sometimes it can be useful to have the same ELOG logbook on two different
   computers. This might be the case if you travel with your laptop, but
   want to keep the logbooks from your desktop computer on the laptop. The
   problem is that if you add an entry on your laptop, the logbooks on the
   laptop and the desktop get out of sync. Merging only the ELOG database
   files does not help, since two entries could be made at the same day on
   the laptop and the desktop, which would lead to a conflict in that day's
   database file.
</p>
<p>
   To solve this problem, <i>mirroring</i> was introduced from Version 2.5.0
   on. This technology allows to synchronize one ELOG server with a number
   of other servers on a per-entry basis. No additional software is needed,
   only two elogd daemons talking to each other. The synchronization can be
   executed manually or periodically. If entries are changed/added/deleted
   on both sides, they get merged properly during synchronization. In order
   to minimize network traffic, each ELOG server calculates a MD5 checksum
   for each message, which gets exchanged during synchronization. Only when
   the MD5 checksum differs, entries are transferred.
</p>
<p>
   To set-up mirroring, install two elogd servers on two machines (for
   testing purpose that also works on one machine with two elogd servers
   running on different ports). This can be done in two ways:
</p>
<ol>
   <li>
      <b>Automatic configuration</b>
      <p>
         A complete elog server can be transferred to a secondary server using
         the <code><b>clone</b></code> command. Assume the existing server
         resides at <code><b>http://master.your.domain/</b></code>, and you
         want to mirror this server to a new location at
         <code><b>http://slave.your.domain/</b></code>. You do that by
         installing the elog package at the slave machine, and then executing
         on the slave:
      </p>
      <pre>
elogd -C http://master.your.domain
</pre>
      or
      <pre>
elogd -C https://master.your.domain
</pre>
      for a remote server running under the SSL protocol.
      <p>
         This command tells elogd to retrieve the configuration file, and
         optionally all logbook entries and password files from the master
         machine. Note that both servers must be version 2.5.4 or later. In
         case of trouble, you can turn on verbose messaging:
      </p>
      <pre>
elogd -v -C http://master.your.domain
</pre>
      <p>
         which could give some hints. If a logbook on the master server uses
         restricted access, you have to specify the admin user name and
         password. After everything has been transferred, you can start elogd
         in the normal way.
      </p>
   </li>
   <li>
      <b>Manual configuration</b>
      <p>
         First, copy the elogd.cfg file from the master to the slave server.
         Make sure that the files are identical (except the port setting if
         you run two servers on the same machine). Then, add the following
         configuration options. They should be put into the [global] section
         of the cofiguration file:
      </p>
      <ul>
         <li>
            <b><code>Mirror server = &lt;URL-list&gt;</code></b><br>
            <br>
            This statement specifies one or more mirror servers. Each URL must
            contain the host, port and possible subdirectory of the remote
            server, as if you would access it through your browser. A typical
            statement looks like:<br>
            <br>
            <code>Mirror server = myhost.mydomain.org:8080,
               http://another.server.org/elog/, https://yet.another.org</code><br>
            <br>
            The URL should not contain any logbook name, this gets added
            automatically. The second example contains a subdirectory, which is
            typically used if the elogd daemon runs under an Apache proxy.
            The third example shows a server running under the SSL protocol.
         </li>
         <li>
            <b><code>Mirror config = 0 | 1</code></b><br>
            <br>
            Normally, only the logbook entries are mirrored. One can also
            mirror the contents of the elogd.cfg configuration file for
            individual logbooks. This can be turned on by setting this option
            to <b><code>1</code></b>. Default is <b><code>0</code></b>. Only
            the individual logbook section is mirrored, not the [global]
            section. Settings which are specific to one server, for example the
            <b><code>URL =</code></b> statement, should then be kept in the
            [global] section, so that they are not mirrored between different
            servers.<br>
            <br>
         </li>
         <li>
            <b><code>Mirror cron = Minute Hour Day Month Weekday</code></b><br>
            <br>
            This statement turns on periodic mirroring. The format is similar
            to the UNIX <code><b>cron</b></code> command. Each of the five
            values can either be an asterisk, which means all possible values,
            a comma-separated list or a range. It can be explained most easily
            with examples:<br>
            <br>
            <table border="1">
               <tr>
                  <th>
                     Mirror cron=
                  </th>
                  <th>
                     meaning
                  </th>
               </tr>
               <tr>
                  <td>

            If mirroring is turned on, it is advisable to use the
            <b><code>Logfile =</code></b> option to turn on logging, so that
            one can inspect the logfile to see if the mirroring works
            correctly.<br>
            <br>
         </li>
         <li>
            <b><code>Mirror user = &lt;name&gt;</code></b><br>
            <br>
            If periodic mirroring is used via the <code><b>Mirror cron
            =</b></code> statement and the remote logbook uses user-level
            access, this statement specifies the user name which is used to log
            in to the remote logbook. The password is taken from the local
            password file and has to match the password in the remote password
            file, otherwise the access is not allowed. The user name is typical
            the login name of the administrator.<br>
            <br>
         </li>
         <li>
            <b><code>Mirror simulate = 0 | 1</code></b><br>
            <br>
            If one wants to try out mirroring without causing any harm, one can
            turn on this flag. During synchronization, entries are compared and
            necessary transfers are displayed, but not executed. Default is
            <b><code>0</code></b>.<br>
            <br>
         </li>
         <li>
            <b><code>Mirror exclude = 0 | 1</code></b><br>
            <br>
            By default, all logbooks are mirrored. Individual logbooks might be
            excluded from mirroring by putting <b><code>Mirror exclude =
            1</code></b> in their individual logbook section of the
            configuration file (<b>Not</b> the [global] section). Default is
            <b><code>0</code></b>.
         </li>
      </ul>
   </li>
</ol>
<p>
   If the statement <code><b>Mirror server</b></code> is present in the
   configuration file, a new menu option <b><code>"Synchronize"</code></b>
   appears on the elog page. Clicking on this menu options starts the
   synchronization:<br>
   <br>
   <img src="sync.gif"><br>
   <br>
   On the left side one sees the entry ID's. Entries which are equal locally
   and remotely are not displayed. Here are the rules for
   synchronization:<br>
   <br>
</p>
<ul>
   <li>If an entry has been modified locally but not remotely, it is
      submitted to the remote server.
   </li>
   <li>If an entry has been modified remotely but not locally, it is
      retrieved from the remote server and saved locally.
   </li>
   <li>If an entry has been modified remotely and locally since the last
      synchronization, an error is shown that the entries are conflicting. In
      that case one has to merge the entries manually and delete it on one
      side.
   </li>
   <li>If an entry has been deleted locally, it is deleted remotely.
   </li>
   <li>If an entry has been deleted remotely, it is deleted locally.
   </li>
   <li>If a new entry exists locally, it is submitted.
   </li>
   <li>If a new entry exists remotely, it is retrieved from the remote
      server and saved locally.
   </li>
   <li>If new entries exist locally and remotely having the same entry ID,
      the local entries are changed to have higher entry IDs, then the remote
      ones are retrieved. Care should be taken if external links (such as
      <b><code>elog:123</code></b>) to the local entries are used, since they
      will point afterwards to the wrong entry.
   </li>
</ul>
<p>
   By starting the synchronization on one elogd server, this server becomes
   the client and the other one becomes the server. This means that the
   local server actively compares the local and the remote messages, and
   updates one or the other if necessary. The other (remote) server does not
   need to have any mirror option in its configuration file, since the local
   server simulates a web browser to send and retrieve messages to the
   remote server. It is however allowed that the remote server also contains
   some mirror settings in the configuration file, this way the
   synchronization can be started from both servers.
